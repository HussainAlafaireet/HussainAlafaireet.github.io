&lt;p&gt;The term “FODMAP” is a diet regimen for those that suffer from the gastrointestinal condition known as Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS).  Foods in the FODMAP diet.  Adhering to the foods in the diet can help to prevent the pain IBS sufferers deal with after eating non-IBS safe food.  The goal of this design challenge was to develop a logo for a fictitious FODMAP mobile diet app called “FODMAPPA”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;design-process&quot;&gt;Design Process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried a few different avenues for the logo design, two of which can be seen below.  Most of my initial logo designs tried to build a stylized version of an intestinal track, or letters textured to look somewhat like an intestinal track.  These designs didn’t test well in my initial feedback, as that imagery was considered somewhat uncomfortable on the part of my interviewees.  However, the food-related sketch tested much better, as food is seen as more approachable.  I decided to iterate over the food-related sketch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I originally included three FODMAP-friendly foods, an orange, a carrot, and a cup of coffee on my sketch.  I tried building the sketch in Illustrator, and wasn’t initially happy from with the look of it. (see below).  I had tried to keep the logo abstract, but the end result was both pretty amateurish-looking, and too complex.  Based on a second round of feedback, I dropped the carrot and the coffee cup, and centered on playing with the orange itself.  The direction I ended up going with was to remove the outline of the orange, and instead use the arrangement of the individual orange slices to create the overall shape of the orange.  This created a circular logo capable of taking advantage of negative space, and one would work well for an app design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of this particular design challenge was to develop a fruit collage using a botanical picture of my favorite fruit as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pinterest.com/pin/470907704772950511/&quot;&gt;base&lt;/a&gt;, with a word mixed in.  The word was to correspond with the symbolic of the meaning of the fruit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;design-process&quot;&gt;Design Process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Western culture, the cherry has connotations relating to sex and sensuality.  I chose the word “Desire” to in order to reflect these concepts while a) keeping the character count to something easily managed, and b) keeping the poster “safe for work”.  The color choice for the font was derived from the primary red color of the base image.  The typeface use for the word is Lucida Calligraphy, and was selected for both its handwritten feel (feeling more intimate), as well as for its curved nature (in keeping with the theme of sensuality). The roughly “S” shape of the character placement continues with the theme of curves and sensuality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;project-outcome&quot;&gt;Project Outcome&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final result of the design can be seen below.  Overall, I am pleased with how it came out, those I still wonder about the readability of the right-to-left direction shift from the first S to the I.  Beyond that, I think I hit the main points of the design challenge well!

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked on a fairly interesting assignment the last week of February 2018.  I was paired up with another aspiring
UX professional, to act as the eyes and ears for a University of Michigan student design team working with Zaman International.  Zaman International is a Detroit-area non-profit supporting marginalized women and children.  The organization provides a mix of social services, vocational training, and physical donations to its clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;client-problem&quot;&gt;Client Problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zaman International wants to improve the process donors have when they drop off donations at the Zaman headquarters.  Right now, the process involves a high degree of paper forms and post-donation accounting.  The UofM Design Clinic team is working with Zaman International to develop a tablet-based kiosk system that will provide a quicker and more seemless experience for donors.  To design the system appropriately, the Design Clinic team needed much more in-depth details about the existing donation processes than remote interviews would ever provide.  That’s where me and my partner came in!  Our job was to spend a week at the Zaman International headquarters, observing as many aspects of the donation process as possible, and interviewing all of the Zaman employees involved in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;activity-summary&quot;&gt;Activity Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of 5 days, we interviewed 8 key stakeholders and participants in the donation process.  We also observed the headquarters area, taking numerous pictures of various artifacts, both physical and digital, pertaining to the donation process. I took the primary role of Interviewer for this project.  It was my job to talk to our interviewees, and develop insights from the ensuring conversation.  These were not standard Q&amp;amp;A interviews, but deeper contextual inquiry interviews designed to pull details from the participants even they didn’t realize they knew.  I had to maintain a certain level of balance for these interviews, making sure to give the interviewee room to delve into deeper issues I would have never thought to ask about, but still keep the interview overall on track.  My success in these interviews shows that my interviewing skills have increased since I started doing them last year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;project-outcome&quot;&gt;Project Outcome&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the interviews and observations were complete, my partner and I collated our data via a light version of the Affinity Wall data summation technique.  From this, we were able to generate a set of process flow diagrams and related recommendations which we presented to both Zaman International and the Design Clinic team.  The process flow diagrams in particular gave the Design Clinic team a much better idea of what they were dealing with, and the affinity notes left them with a wealth of further data they can mine for additional insights!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Email</name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Project: The Introducer</title><link href="/portfolio/project/2018/01/12/Projects-The-Introducer.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Project:  The Introducer" /><published>2018-01-12T19:12:11-05:00</published><updated>2018-01-12T19:12:11-05:00</updated><id>/portfolio/project/2018/01/12/Projects-The-Introducer</id><content type="html" xml:base="/portfolio/project/2018/01/12/Projects-The-Introducer.html">&lt;p&gt;The project covers the design prototype I developed for my Fall 2017 Interaction Design class at the University of Michigan’s Master’s in Information Science program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-problem&quot;&gt;The Problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New university students face many personal challenges as they adapt to their new circumstances.  They often move away from their existing social network of friends and family, and into a complex and unstructured university environment.  Having little immediate common ground with others in their living spaces, and overwhelmed by demanding university class workload, students can feel alone, isolated, even in the midst of an apartment complex filled with other people.  My solution challenges this situation, and allows students to turn social barriers into opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-solution&quot;&gt;The Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The target solution for this problem is a smartphone app called &lt;em&gt;“The Introducer”&lt;/em&gt;.  A user of this system will be able to use the app in conjunction with QR codes mounted on the door of another fellow apartment dweller.  Scanning the code will then let the user view a pre-recorded introduction of the resident, built by the resident themselves.  This will allow the user to get to know their neighbors in a convenient, low-stress way, while giving them knowledge that can be used to start a face-to-face conversation.  The application is gated by a login system controlled by the apartment complex administrators, which protects the safety and privacy of the apartment complex residents.  The intent is that the application is ultimately maintained by a third-party development organization, which whom apartment complexes can contract with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;design-tools-used&quot;&gt;Design Tools Used&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storyboarding:&lt;/strong&gt;  Storyboard sketches were developed in order to create initial design demos that could be used to get user feedback.  The virtual introduction paradigm was selected by user feedback out of the 8 initial design ideas presented by the storyboard.  See below for the storyboard for the winning design, which was developed into &lt;em&gt;The Introducer&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paper Prototype:&lt;/strong&gt;  After the storyboarding, a paper prototype of the selected virtual introduction solution was developed with notecards, pen, and post-it notes.  This paper prototype incorporated several potential design decisions, and was again placed out in front of potential users.  See below for a video demonstration of the paper prototype.&lt;/p&gt;

I worked on a consulting team with 3 other members to assist a local non-profit called &lt;strong&gt;Detroit Green Map&lt;/strong&gt;.  Together, we analyzed the client’s specified problem, developed recommendations, and presented them to the client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;client-problem&quot;&gt;Client Problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our client was a local area non-profit organization focusing encouraging the efforts of local business to become more environmentally conscious.  The client organization had experienced a growth surge in recent years, and found it’s communication, documentation, and project management structure to be unable to fully manage the new team structure.  The organization was a virtual team, with remote team members in a variety of locations.  The decentralized nature of the team was an additional factor exacerbating the problems with the new team size.  The client wanted our team to review the organization’s current processes and tooling, and make suggestions to improve communication and project management within the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;analysis-methodology&quot;&gt;Analysis Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our analysis process was broken down into the following procedure steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interviewing:&lt;/strong&gt;  Our team collected our base data via semi-structured interviews with the members of the client organization.  These interviews were the core of the Contextual Inquiry methodology, as they were not standard question-and-answer interviews.  Instead, our team took on the role of apprentices, having the interviewees walk us directly through their day-to-day work process.  We were thus able to see the daily processes, tools, documentation, and deliverables actually used by the organization.  This level of detail gave a wealth of data points about the organizations’ communication and collaboration issues.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;​&lt;strong&gt;Affinity Wall Analysis:&lt;/strong&gt; Our interviews gave us a wealth of data, but with only a limited amount of structure.  In order to organize our data, we used a technique known as an &lt;em&gt;Affinity Wall&lt;/em&gt;.  We wrote down individual data points onto Post-It notes, and then organized the notes based on connections we found by comparing the notes.  By adding summary notes to the emerging groups, and then repeating the process with the summary notes, we were able to drill down to the root findings behind the communication issues. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/si_501_affinity_wall.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Affinity Wall&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;​&lt;strong&gt;Brainstorming:&lt;/strong&gt; Once we had determined the root causes of the issues, we brainstormed a series of potential solutions, and then ranked the solutions according to a set of criteria that included aspects such as feasibility, ease-of-use, cost, etc.  With this process, we were able to narrow down our list of solutions to three primary solutions:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;A collaboration plan, to formally define the communication/collaboration strategy.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;A recruiting plan, to ensure that new team members had skills the team really needs, including strong communication skills.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Slack tooling:  We noticed that our client was losing information due to the fact that their primary communication and information/archive tool was email.  We recommended moving day-to-day communications to a Slack server to create an archived, searchable communication environment.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;client-deliverables&quot;&gt;Client Deliverables&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we had our list of solutions, we developed both a final report and final presentation.  We delivered the report first, as the presentation session needed to be delayed due to scheduling.  When we presented, we found that our client had read our report already, and were in the process of implementing our recommendations!  My team is confident that we’ve made a real difference to our client, and that we’ve helped them solve the issues they had us analyze.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Email</name></author><summary type="html">This entry covers a consulting project I worked on in Fall 2018.
