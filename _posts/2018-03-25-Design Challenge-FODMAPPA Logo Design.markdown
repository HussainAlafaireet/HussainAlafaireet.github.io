### Design Challenge

The term "FODMAP" is a diet regimen for those that suffer from the gastrointestinal condition known as Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS).  Foods in the FODMAP diet.  Adhering to the foods in the diet can help to prevent the pain IBS sufferers deal with after eating non-IBS safe food.  The goal of this design challenge was to develop a logo for a fictitious FODMAP mobile diet app called "FODMAPPA".

### Design Process
I tried a few different avenues for the logo design, two of which can be seen below.  Most of my initial logo designs tried to build a stylized version of an intestinal track, or letters textured to look somewhat like an intestinal track.  These designs didn't test well in my initial feedback, as that imagery was considered somewhat uncomfortable on the part of my interviewees.  However, the food-related sketch tested much better, as food is seen as more approachable.  I decided to iterate over the food-related sketch.

I originally included three FODMAP-friendly foods, an orange, a carrot, and a cup of coffee on my sketch.  I tried building the sketch in Illustrator, and wasn't initially happy from with the look of it. (see below).  I had tried to keep the logo abstract, but the end result was both pretty amateurish-looking, and too complex.  Based on a second round of feedback, I dropped the carrot and the coffee cup, and centered on playing with the orange itself.  The direction I ended up going with was to remove the outline of the orange, and instead use the arrangement of the individual orange slices to create the overall shape of the orange.  This created a circular logo capable of taking advantage of negative space, and one would work well for an app design.
