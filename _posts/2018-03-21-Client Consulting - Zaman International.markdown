I worked on a fairly interesting assignment the last week of February 2018.  I was paired up with another aspiring
UX professional, to act as the eyes and ears for a University of Michigan student design team working with Zaman International.  Zaman International is a Detroit-area non-profit supporting marginalized women and children.  The organization provides a mix of social services, vocational training, and physical donations to its clients.

### Client Problem
Zaman International wants to improve the process donors have when they drop off donations at the Zaman headquarters.  Right now, the process involves a high degree of paper forms and post-donation accounting.  The UofM Design Clinic team is working with Zaman International to develop a tablet-based kiosk system that will provide a quicker and more seemless experience for donors.  To design the system appropriately, the Design Clinic team needed much more in-depth details about the existing donation processes than remote interviews would ever provide.  That's where me and my partner came in!  Our job was to spend a week at the Zaman International headquarters, observing as many aspects of the donation process as possible, and interviewing all of the Zaman employees involved in the process.

### Activity Summary

Over the course of 5 days, we interviewed 8 key stakeholders and participants in the donation process.  We also observed the headquarters area, taking numerous pictures of various artifacts, both physical and digital, pertaining to the donation process. I took the primary role of Interviewer for this project.  It was my job to talk to our interviewees, and develop insights from the ensuring conversation.  These were not standard Q&A interviews, but deeper contextual inquiry interviews designed to pull details from the participants even they didn't realize they knew.  I had to maintain a certain level of balance for these interviews, making sure to give the interviewee room to delve into deeper issues I would have never thought to ask about, but still keep the interview overall on track.  My success in these interviews shows that my interviewing skills have increased since I started doing them last year!

### Project Outcome
After the interviews and observations were complete, my partner and I collated our data via a light version of the Affinity Wall data summation technique.  From this, we were able to generate a set of process flow diagrams and related recommendations which we presented to both Zaman International and the Design Clinic team.  The process flow diagrams in particular gave the Design Clinic team a much better idea of what they were dealing with, and the affinity notes left them with a wealth of further data they can mine for additional insights!
