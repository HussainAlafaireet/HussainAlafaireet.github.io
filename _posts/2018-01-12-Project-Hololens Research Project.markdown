I am current working on a research project with a University of Michigan faculty member.  We are trying to develop a  interface for the Microsoft Hololens augmented reality headset.  This new interface will give users the ability to manipulate Hololens virtual objects without knowing how to code or develop 3-D objects via the Unity game development editor.  This new interface will open up a level of augmented reality manipulation that those without Hololens development skills can't currently access.  More to come on this soon!
