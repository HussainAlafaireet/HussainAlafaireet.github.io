For a design challenge, I built a fruit collage image, using a botanical image of my favorite fruit as the base.


### Design Challenge
The goal of this particular design challenge was to develop a fruit collage using a botanical picture of my favorite fruit as the [base](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/470907704772950511/), with a word mixed in.  The word was to correspond with the symbolic of the meaning of the fruit.

### Design Process
In Western culture, the cherry has connotations relating to sex and sensuality.  I chose the word "Desire" to in order to reflect these concepts while a) keeping the character count to something easily managed, and b) keeping the poster "safe for work".  The color choice for the font was derived from the primary red color of the base image.  The typeface use for the word is Lucida Calligraphy, and was selected for both its handwritten feel (feeling more intimate), as well as for its curved nature (in keeping with the theme of sensuality). The roughly "S" shape of the character placement continues with the theme of curves and sensuality.


### Project Outcome

The final result of the design can be seen below.  Overall, I am pleased with how it came out, those I still wonder about the readability of the right-to-left direction shift from the first S to the I.  Beyond that, I think I hit the main points of the design challenge well!
