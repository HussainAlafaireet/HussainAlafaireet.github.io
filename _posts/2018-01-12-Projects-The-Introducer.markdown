The project covers the design prototype I developed for my Fall 2017 Interaction Design class at the University of Michigan's Master's in Information Science program.

### The Problem
New university students face many personal challenges as they adapt to their new circumstances.  They often move away from their existing social network of friends and family, and into a complex and unstructured university environment.  Having little immediate common ground with others in their living spaces, and overwhelmed by demanding university class workload, students can feel alone, isolated, even in the midst of an apartment complex filled with other people.  My solution challenges this situation, and allows students to turn social barriers into opportunities.

### The Solution
The target solution for this problem is a smartphone app called *"The Introducer"*.  A user of this system will be able to use the app in conjunction with QR codes mounted on the door of another fellow apartment dweller.  Scanning the code will then let the user view a pre-recorded introduction of the resident, built by the resident themselves.  This will allow the user to get to know their neighbors in a convenient, low-stress way, while giving them knowledge that can be used to start a face-to-face conversation.  The application is gated by a login system controlled by the apartment complex administrators, which protects the safety and privacy of the apartment complex residents.  The intent is that the application is ultimately maintained by a third-party development organization, which whom apartment complexes can contract with.

### Design Tools Used  

**Storyboarding:**  Storyboard sketches were developed in order to create initial design demos that could be used to get user feedback.  The virtual introduction paradigm was selected by user feedback out of the 8 initial design ideas presented by the storyboard.  See below for the storyboard for the winning design, which was developed into *The Introducer*.

**Paper Prototype:**  After the storyboarding, a paper prototype of the selected virtual introduction solution was developed with notecards, pen, and post-it notes.  This paper prototype incorporated several potential design decisions, and was again placed out in front of potential users.  See below for a video demonstration of the paper prototype.

**Digital Prototype:**  an electronic prototype was developing using the Axure prototyping toolset, with additional widgets from  the Axure iOS Flat Wireframe Template, UX Tool Time Android Template Library, and Flaticon.com.
