      <h1>The Room Model - A Vision of an XR Browser</h1>
      

      <h2>Project Overview - Extending CSS to Control Augmented Reality</h2>
      <p>I participated in a research project controlled by Mozilla and the University of Michigan.  The overall aim 
          of the project was to develop visions and future directions for the concept of a <strong> Mixed Reality internet browser</strong> 
          - a browser that can intermix traditional 2-D internet content with Augmented and Virtual Reality content.
  
            <br>
          I worked on one question within this overall vision. How can we 
          extend the specifications of CSS to control the look, behavior, and position of this AR content in an intelligent way?
        </p>

      <h2>My Contributions - Thinker and Implementer</h2>
      <p>I made 3 main contributions to this project:
        <ol>
          <li>I developed the concept of the "Room Model" - a multi-faceted model for intelligent AR object placement.</li>
          <li>I developed a "playground" with which to explore the idea of controlling AR object layouts via simulated physics.</li>
          <li>I generated a view of how a future CSS specification might be written to cover both of the above concepts</li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <h2>Problem to be Solved - How Can We Make AR Controllable on the Web?</h2>
      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used today to control the overall
          look and feel of webpages.  However, in thinking about the concept of an XR Browser, it becomes obvious that today's CSS 
          specifications dont cover the use of AR content integrated into the Web.  For web programmers to integrate and control AR content using their 
          existing skillsets, the CSS specifications need to be extended to cover AR.  My goal for this project was to develop a vision of how this new specification
          would function.
      <h2>Brainstorming - Building the Walls of the Room Model </h2>
      <p>My first step was to look at pre-existing work in the space of AR layout control, and beging brainstorming solutions to
        extend that work.  Two areas of my research stuck out to me the most.  The first area was the Box Model built into the current CSS specification.  This model is the 
      underlying basis of layout in CSS.  I felt that if I could extend this model to cover AR objects and 3-D space, doing so would allow an easier
    transition for web programmers when using AR content.  This approach lead to the underlying basis of the Room Model: The AR Cube. </p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-6">
          <figure class="figure">
            <img src="/assets/RoomModel/rm_cube_01.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">The Anchor model that acted as the basis of the Room Model</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>
        <div class="col-6">
          <figure class="figure">
            <img src="/assets/RoomModel/rm_cube_02.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">An expanded sketch of the Anchor Model, with styling discussion. </figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>The AR Cube, like the Box Model before it, encloses content (in this case AR content) within a bounded area.  The basics 
        of the AR cube are quite similar to the Box model, with an inner "content" area, and an external border (which can be invisible or visible).
        However, even at this early stage, new, AR specific elements were worked in.  For example, I was considering a concept in which the AR cube has a 
        "forcefield" around it, that bounces other content off of it.  This concept would be revisited later in the project.

        <br>
        <br>
        After building a concept for how each individual AR object might look in an extended CSS, it was time to develop how an 
        entire room might look like.  Fortunately, previous research into "spatial AR" (Thomas et al. 2014) helped develop a concept.
        In the concept of spatial AR, all AR content in a physical space is anchored above flat surfaces such as tables.  Placing AR objects near surfaces like these
        gives users specific locations and context that helps them understand how the AR object works.  
        <br>
        <br>
        Taking the idea of spatial AR and applying to the concept of CSS AR Extensions, I developed the core concept of the Room Model - also a model about spatial placement based on context.
      </p>
