      <h1>Physics CSS Browser Concept</h1>


      <h2>Project Overview - Extending CSS to Control Augmented Reality</h2>
      <p>I participated in a research project controlled by Mozilla and the University of Michigan. The overall aim
        of the project was to develop visions and future directions for the concept of a <strong> Mixed Reality internet
          browser</strong>
        - a browser that can intermix traditional 2-D internet content with Augmented and Virtual Reality content.

        <br>
        <br>
        I worked on one question within this overall vision. How can we
        extend the specifications of CSS to control the look, behavior, and position of this AR content in an
        intelligent way?
      </p>

      <h2>My Contributions - Thinker and Implementer</h2>
      <p>I made 3 main contributions to this project:
        <ol>
          <li>I developed the concept of the "Room Model" - a multi-faceted model for intelligent AR object placement.
          </li>
          <li>I developed a "playground" with which to explore the idea of controlling AR object layouts via simulated
            physics.</li>
          <li>I generated a view of how a future CSS specification might be written to cover both of the above concepts
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <h2>Problem to be Solved - How Can We Make AR Controllable on the Web?</h2>
      <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used today to control the overall
        look and feel of webpages. However, in thinking about the concept of an XR Browser, it becomes obvious that
        today's CSS
        specifications dont cover the use of AR content integrated into the Web. For web programmers to integrate and
        control AR content using their
        existing skillsets, the CSS specifications need to be extended to cover AR. My goal for this project was to
        develop a vision of how this new specification
        would function.</p>
      <h2>Brainstorming - Building the Walls of the Room Model </h2>
      <h3>The AR Cube - How do we control individual pieces of AR content?</h3>
      <p>My first step was to look at pre-existing work in the space of AR layout control, and beging brainstorming
        solutions to
        extend that work. Two areas of my research stuck out to me the most. The first area was the Box Model built into
        the current CSS specification. This model is the
        underlying basis of layout in CSS. I felt that if I could extend this model to cover AR objects and 3-D space,
        doing so would allow an easier
        transition for web programmers when using AR content. This approach lead to the underlying basis of the Room
        Model: The AR Cube. </p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-6">
          <figure href="/assets/RoomModel/rm_cube_01.jpg" class="figure" data-toggle="lightbox"
            data-footer="The Anchor model that acted as the basis of the Room Model">
            <img src="/assets/RoomModel/rm_cube_01.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">The Anchor model that acted as the basis of the Room Model
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>
        <div class="col-6">
          <figure href="/assets/RoomModel/rm_cube_02.jpg" class="figure" data-toggle="lightbox"
          data-footer="An expanded sketch of the Anchor Model, with styling
          discussion. ">
            <img src="/assets/RoomModel/rm_cube_02.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">An expanded sketch of the Anchor Model, with styling
              discussion. </figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>The AR Cube, like the Box Model before it, encloses content (in this case AR content) within a bounded area.
        The basics
        of the AR cube are quite similar to the Box model, with an inner "content" area, and an external border (which
        can be invisible or visible).
        However, even at this early stage, new, AR specific elements were worked in. For example, I was considering a
        concept in which the AR cube has a
        "forcefield" around item. This forcefield concept roughly corresponds to the "margin" property in CSS, as a
        preventative measure to ensure content pieces don't overlap with each other. The forcefield around a piece of AR
        content would "bounce" other AR content away from its designated area.
        <br>
        Even at this early stage, ideas like the forcefield showed how naturally the use of simulated physics fit into
        the mix of CSS extension. Use of physics
        would return multiple times over the course of the project.


        <br>
        <br>
        After building a concept for how each individual AR object might look in an extended CSS, it was time to develop
        how an
        entire room might look like. Fortunately, previous research into "spatial AR" (Thomas et al. 2014) helped
        develop a concept.
        In the concept of spatial AR, all AR content in a physical space is anchored above flat surfaces such as tables.
        Placing AR objects near surfaces like these
        gives users specific locations and context that helps them understand how the AR object works.
        <br>
        <br>
        Taking the idea of spatial AR and applying to the concept of CSS AR Extensions, I developed the core concept of
        the Room Model - also a model about spatial placement based on context.
        The Room Model is built around the concept of <strong>anchors</strong>. Anchors refer to physical objects in a
        given environment that have some kind of context with which
        to justify placing an AR object near. In keeping with spatial AR, tables are the most common example of anchors.
        However, the Room Model posits the idea of
        a wider variety of anchors. Posters, windows, monitors, and light sources are all additional examples of anchor
        type. The Room Model further posits that specific types
        of anchors afford different AR interactions to be controlled with CSS. A table might have a volumetric cube
        hovering above it, a poster might have plane-shaped AR placed above it, etc.

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-2"></div>
          <div class="col-8">
            <figure href="/assets/RoomModel/window_sketch.jpg" class="figure" data-toggle="lightbox"
            data-footer="Brainstorming sketch of the “Window” anchor type, and what
            kinds of styling options it might have.">
              <img src="/assets/RoomModel/window_sketch.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
              <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Brainstorming sketch of the “Window” anchor type, and what
                kinds of styling options it might have.</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>
          <div class="col-2"></div>
        </div>

        Here is an example of one specific type of anchor - one built to overlay a physical window. This "window anchor"
        is shaped as a 2-D plane, in keeping
        with the idea that a see-through window is usable on either side. The window anchor has two unique behaviors to
        be controlled by CSS. The first is the ability to "flip"
        the AR content in order to reverse what AR content is being shown on each side of the window. The second unique
        behavior is to control if the window anchor is in fact double-sided, or if only one side of
        the plane should have active AR content.
        <br>

        To further demostrate the window anchor concept, I built two demos in the Aframe Web-based VR standard.
        <br>

        <h4>"Flippable" Demo</h4>

        <br>
        <br>
        This video shows a Aframe VR-based demo of how the "flippable" behavior might look in practice.
        <br>

        <h4>"Forcefield" Demo</h4>
        <a href="https://aframecssextension.glitch.me/index_old.html">Live Demo Link (Works best in Firefox)</a>

          </video>
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>

        This video shows a demo showing the "forcefield" concept to control AR object overlap. This implementation
        attaches collider areas (the multi-colored bands in the video)
        to two AR objects. The backend code in this demo actually has the two objects initially overlapping the same
        physical space, as the colliders detect a collision, the two objects are
        forced apart a set distance.
        <br>

        <h3>The Room Model - How do we control an entire room of AR objects?</h3>

        Now that I had developed a basic set of prototypes of how each individual piece of AR content could be
        controlled with CSS, it was time to
        look at prototyping how an entire room might be controlled intelligently. For this part of the ideation process,
        I built a set
        of Photoshop mockups to create an initial vision of how the Room Model might control a room, based on the
        underlying principles of spatial AR.
      </p>


      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-2"></div>
        <div class="col-8">
          <figure href="/assets/RoomModel/css_prototype-01.jpg" class="figure" data-toggle="lightbox"
          data-footer="Room Model - Initial Object Scan">
            <img src="/assets/RoomModel/css_prototype-01.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Room Model - Initial Object Scan</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>
        <div class="col-2"></div>
      </div>

      <p>This particular rendition of the Room Model does assume the existence of an <strong>object scanner</strong> - a
        computer vision component
        capable of recognizing objects in the environment. In the first step of the Room Model process, the object
        scanner activates and begins scanning a user's room.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-2"></div>
        <div class="col-8">
          <figure href="/assets/RoomModel/css_prototype-02.jpg" class="figure" data-toggle="lightbox"
          data-footer="Room Model - Establishing a Room">

          </figure>
        </div>
        <div class="col-2"></div>
      </div>

      <p>This initial scan of the room establishes the overall dimensions of the room and establishes an overall area
        that AR content could be placed in.
        The overall Room Model functionality would then generate some base HTML representing the room.
      </p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-2"></div>
        <div class="col-8">
          <figure href="/assets/RoomModel/css_prototype-03.jpg" class="figure" data-toggle="lightbox"

          </figure>
        </div>
        <div class="col-2"></div>
      </div>

      <p>In the next phase of the Room Model setup, the object scanner scans for potential anchor points that can be
        used as specific locations to place
        AR content. Within the overall room HTML, the Room Model then generates initial HTML for each anchor point it
        identifies.
      </p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-2"></div>
        <div class="col-8">

            </figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>
        <div class="col-2"></div>
      </div>

      <p>The Room Model has now set up the room for AR content placement. Specific physical objects ripe for AR content
        have been
        identified. In addition, free space between physical objects that could also have AR objects placed in them are
        identified.
      </p>


      <h2>Physics-Based Layouts - A Switch In Direction</h2>

      <p>Now that the initial ideation has established the core concepts of the AR Cube and the Room Model, it was time
        to start moving towards more robust prototypes that moved
        towards real-world application. As the concept of using physics to actually control the interactions of AR
        objects had come up within the Room Model, developing a more functional physics-based interaction
        system was the next major goal.
        <br>
        <h3>Pre-implementation Brainstorming - What Strategies can be used for Physics-based Layouts?</h3>
        Before I starting developing the physics-based interaction system, I needed to have a stronger idea of what the
        end goal interactions might be.
        How would a physic-based system control the exact physical locations of AR content in a coherent way? What
        stategies could a physic-based layout control use? In particular,
        what stategies should be used when a set of AR content is moved from one room to another?
        After a round of brainstorming on potential solutions, I settled on 3 initial strategies for AR room layout
        control via physics - blackhole, location, and anchor-matching.
        To more fully-flesh out my paper-based brainstorming, I built an AFrame demo for each strategy, using, for the
        moment, canned animations rather than physics.
        <br>
      </p>


      <H4>Blackhole Strategy</H4>
      <a href="https://aframecssextension.glitch.me/index_rm2_bh.html">Live Demo Link (Works best in Firefox)</a>
      <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">

          <source src="/assets/RoomModel/Room_Model_Blackhole_Demo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video>
      </div>

      <p>
        The first physics-layout control strategy, "blackhole" revolves around the concept of a "master" object that's
        automatically placed in the center
        of a given room. When AR objects are moved into this room, the blackhole strategy pulls all AR objects to the
        center of the room. The blackhole strategy is used as a
        default or "safe" strategy, when there are enough unknowns that other strategies won't work. This strategy
        guaruntees an initially usable AR object layout, as it pulls
        all AR objects to a centralized location that will be accesible in most rooms. However, this stategy will never
        result in an ideal layout that's truly convenient for the user, and therefore
        should only be used as a fallback solution.
      </p>

      <h4>Location Strategy</h4>
      <a href="https://aframecssextension.glitch.me/index_rm2_ps.html">Live Demo Link (Works best in Firefox)</a>
      <p>
        The second control strategy, "location" looks at how AR objects were positined in the users' previous room, and
        attempts to place the AR objects in the same
        spacially-relative position in the new room. This strategy would potentially work well for room tranfers where
        the rooms are of similar dimensions, but is otherwise
        the most limited of the three strategies.

      <a href="https://aframecssextension.glitch.me/index_rm2_am.html">Live Demo Link (Works best in Firefox)</a>
      <p>
        The third strategy, "anchor matching", revolves around the concept of "anchors" that was previously defined in
        the Room Model. This strategies looks at what physical
        anchors each piece of AR content was connecting to in the original room. It then attempts to find a matching
        physical anchor to place the content near (i.e if an AR object was originally
        placed near a window, this strategy will attempt to find a window in the new room to place that AR object near
        to). This is the most interesting and potentially useful strategy,
        as it attempts to take the end-user context behind AR placement into account when switching rooms.

      <h3>Physics Playground Implementations - Let me play with ALL the layouts!</h3>
      Discussion with of the physics-based layouts with my academic stakeholder lead to the decision to create a
      "physics playground" - a virtual environment in which
      we could test various physics-based layout strategies to find which ones worked well. I therefore educated myself
      on the methods AFrame uses to simulate physics, and then built a playground that my stakeholder
      could use to test various layout controls.

      <h4>Playground V1 - Freeform Controls</h4>

      <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
        <video class="embed-responsive-item" width="320" height="240" controls muted>
          <source src="/assets/RoomModel/RoomModel_Physic_playground_demo1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video>
      </div>

      <p>With this initial version of the playground, I attempted to build a freeform environment for adding simulated
        AR objects and
        building layouts. This demo has the following functionality:
        <ol>
          <li>The ability to add any number of simulated AR objects, with physics attached. Objects are adding with
            either a distance
            constraint (which maintains a constant distance between the object and the black sphere), or with a spring
            constraint (which adds an invisible spring with tension between the object and the black sphere.)
          </li>
          <li>The ability to turn the physics interactions on and off. This allows the user to turn physics off and
            manually adjust the position of AR objects. The physics can then be turned on to let physics forces manage
            the positions of AR objects.</li>
          <li>The ability to activate "Blackhole" mode. This functionility uses physics to pull all the AR objects from
            wherever they are to the black sphere, allows for easy AR layout cleanup.
            This functionality is a live, working version of the Blackhole animation-based demo discussed earlier.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Playground V2 - Initial Prebuilt Layout</h4>

        <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
          <video class="embed-responsive-item" width="320" height="240" controls muted>
            <source src="/assets/RoomModel/RoomModel_physics_playground_demo2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
          </video>
        </div>

        <p>Version 2 added a prebuilt layout to show more discretly what a physics-based layout might look like. In this
          version,
          the two AR objects are tied together in a layout by touching them together. The demo detects collision between
          the two objects and attached them
          together via a physics "lock" constraint that sticks them together at the collision point. The two AR objects
          are then manipulated together as one.
        </p>

        <h4>Playground V3 - Complex Prebuilt Layout</h4>
        <a href="http://aframecssextension.glitch.me/index_superhands2.html">Live Demo Link (Works best in Firefox)</a>
        <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
          <video class="embed-responsive-item" width="320" height="240" controls muted>
            <source src="/assets/RoomModel/RoomModel_Physics_Layout_demo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
          </video>
        </div>

        <p>Version 3 utilizes a more complex layout scenario, with 8 separate AR objects. All physics interactions
          between the objects are activated
          by touching them together. The AR objects will attach themselves in a wide variety of ways, and one of the
          objects is even "squishable" (the object will be reduced in size
          every time it collides with another object.). This demo allows the user to test a variety of layout
          configurations without having to utilize the main control panel implemented in version 1.</p>


        <h2>Defining the CSS - Putting it all together</h2>

        <p>The project now had models for three key components of AR object control: The AR Cube (how to control
          individual objects), the Room Model (how to control the entire room), and the Physic Model (how to control the
          direct interactions between objects). How do these models tie together back into the extension of CSS that was
          the original goal of the project? My final task in this project was to provide a final, merged model that
          answered this question. I called the final model "Physics CSS", and here's how it works: </p>

        <h3>Physics CSS Concepts - Core AR Object Properties</h3>
        <p>The Core AR Object Properties correspond to the AR Cube, in that they define the basic characteristics of an
          individual AR object. These basic properties are:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Mass:</strong>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Positioning:</strong>

            <li><strong>Anchor Type:</strong> </li>
            <li><strong>Collision Type Property:</strong> </li>
          </ul>

          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-2"></div>
            <div class="col-8">
              <figure href="/assets/RoomModel/corecssmockup.PNG" class="figure" data-toggle="lightbox"
              data-footer="Example CSS Mockup code for the core definition of a
              Physic Model AR Object">
                <img src="/assets/RoomModel/corecssmockup.PNG" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Example CSS Mockup code for the core definition of a
                  Physic Model AR Object</figcaption>
              </figure>
            </div>
            <div class="col-2"></div>
          </div>
        </p>

        <h3>Mass</h3>
        <p>This numeric property corresponds roughly to specificity/importance in standard
          CSS, but much more
          granular. The more mass an
          AR object has, the more important it is in the overall layout. When collision/overall in AR objects occur,
          a master-servant relationship is established between the two objects
          to establish hierarchy. The object with the higher mass in the collision is designated the master. In
          addition, the mass could control other aspects of AR object interactions, such as the look-and-feel
          styling.
          An example, an object with a higher mass might reject attempts to overwrite its styling by a lower-mass
          object.</p>

        <h3>Positioning</h3>
        <p>This property is associated with the Room Layout strategies, and are used
          to determine when
          an AR object from one room is moved to a new physical space.
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Blackhole:</strong> moves the AR object to a central location within the new room.
              Considered to be the
              “safe”
              option most likely to guarantee a working layout configuration.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Location</strong> moves the AR object in the new room to a location as relatively
              (proportionally) close
              to
              the object’s positioning in the original room.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Anchor Matching:</strong> AR object is moved to the physical room object that most closes
              matches the
              physical
              object the AR object was tied to in the original room:
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>AnchorType</h3>
        <p>
          This property incorporates and controls the "anchor" aspects of the Room Model. As part of the this model
          merger, I brainstormed out several additional anchor types:
          <ul>
            <li>Ceiling Anchor: Single large plane</li>
            <li>Poster Anchor: Smaller Plane</li>
            <li>Window Anchor: Double-sided plane</li>
            <li>Monitor Anchor: Single-sided plane designed for computer/TV screen coverage</li>
            <li>Table Anchor: Volumetric Cube hovering over the surface area of the table</li>
            <li>Light Source: Sphere that orbits the associated light source</li>
            <li>Free Space: Volumetric Cube between physical objects.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-2"></div>
          <div class="col-8">
            <figure href="/assets/RoomModel/ceilingcssmockup.PNG" class="figure" data-toggle="lightbox"
            data-footer="Example CSS Mockup code for the AnchorType CSS property.">
              <img src="/assets/RoomModel/ceilingcssmockup.PNG" alt="" class="img-fluid">
              <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Example CSS Mockup code for the AnchorType CSS property.
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>
          <div class="col-2"></div>
        </div>


        <h3>CollisionType</h3>
        <p>
          This property roughly corresponds to the border/margin property of the CSS box model, and incorporates the
          functionality
          from the Physics Playground. The goal of this property is to determine what behavior the object should
          display
          when collision with another object occurs. The possible behaviors are:
          <ul>
            <li>Lock: Objects stick together on the spot with no distance separation in-between.</li>
            <li>Distance: Stick Together, but at a pre-defined distance.</li>
            <li>Repel: Objects forcem themselves away from each other.</li>
            <li>Sqishiness: Instead of connection, this collision type enables resizing. When the objects collide,
              items
              with squishiness get smaller.</li>
            <li>Nothing: Objects don't build a connection. Physics forces via mass alone determine movement during
              collusion. Objects are not linked post-collision.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

      <h2>Final Steps</h2>
      <p>
        The results of this project were presented to my primary academic stakeholder, and will be used as the basis for
        further research
        into the future of the XR Browser.
