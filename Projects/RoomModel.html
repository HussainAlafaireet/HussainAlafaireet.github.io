        <p><strong>Roles: </strong>UX Researcher, UX Designer &nbsp;|&nbsp; <strong>Duration: </strong> 4 Months
          <br>
          <strong>Tools Used: </strong>AFrame Web AR Framework, Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator
          <br>
          <strong>UX Skills Used: </strong> Design Sketching, AR/VR Prototyping, UX Research Review
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Summary: </strong> I was an academic UX researcher for a project sponsored by Mozilla and the
          University
          of Michigan. The aim
          of the project was to develop visions and future directions for the concept of a <strong> Mixed Reality
            internet
            browser</strong>
          - a browser that can intermix traditional 2-D Internet content with Augmented and Virtual Reality content.


          <br>
          <p>I provided an answer to one question within this vision: <strong>How can we
              adapt everyday web technology to control the look, behavior, and position of AR content
              intelligently?</strong></p>

          <br>
          <p>
            <strong>My Contributions: </strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            I developed the "Physics CSS Browser" model - a vision of controlling AR objects using everyday web
            technology. This vision is built on 4 distinct design elements: </p>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>The AR Container</strong>: a flexible container for AR content</li>
            <li><strong>The Room Model:</strong>: a model for AR content placement that makes intuitive sense</li>
            <li><strong>The Physics Playground</strong>: An exploration area for controlling AR content placement with
              game physics</li>
            <li><strong>The Physic CSS Browser</strong>: The model that ties the design elements together.</li>
          </ol>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="container m1">

      <h2 class="text-center"><strong>Process</strong></h2>



      <p>
        I worked as an academic researcher on a project sponsored by Mozilla the University of Michigan. The goal of the
        project
        was
        to explore design concepts for a mixed reality browser - an internet browser designed to merge normal web
        content
        with
        Augmented Reality (AR) content.
        <br>
        <br>

        My specific goal was to develop a method by which web technology could
        be used to control the size and positioning of AR objects. Achieving this goal would allow anyone with web
        programming experience
        to use AR content in their webpages. The result of my work was the <strong>Physics CSS Browser model.</strong>.

      <h3>Brainstorming</h3>

      <h4>Project Research Questions</h4>



      <ul>
        <li>What existing web technologies can we extend to control AR content in a similar manner to 2-D content?</li>
        <li>How can we turn a real-world location into a usable "AR webpage"?</li>
        <li>How can we position "AR webpage" content into the real-world in a way that's intuitive and adaptable?</li>
        <li>Can we use leverage simulated physics to automatically control AR content intuitively? </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>The AR Container</h4>

      <p>
        I began the project by brainstorming ways basic web technology might be used to control AR/VR content.
        <br>
        <br>

        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) immediately jumped to mind as a control method for AR content. CSS is the current
        way web
        programmers control
        how their websites look. Colors, fonts, sizing, and positioning can all be handled in CSS. This CSS is then
        applied to all webpages in a given website,
        to create a consistent look and feel.
        <br>
        <br>
        The <strong>AR Container</strong>
        <br>

        <br>
        <br>

        To extend the Box Model to cover AR content. I developed the concept of the <strong>AR Container</strong>. The
        AR Container is a 3-D container that contains and controls AR content positioned in the real-world.

      <br>
      <br>

      <p>
        This video shows a demo showing the "forcefield" concept to control AR object overlap. This implementation
        attaches collider areas (the multi-colored bands in the video)
        to two AR objects. The backend code in this demo actually has the two objects initially overlapping the same
        physical space, as the colliders detect a collision, the two objects are
        forced apart a set distance.
      </p>


      <p>
        The anchor is intended to be attached to
        a physical object in the real-world, with the physical object determining the shape of the anchor. The AR Anchor
        design ensures that AR content
        is always placed near a physical object of interest, and is shaped to fit in seemlessly with the object of
        interest.

      <br>
      <br>
      <p>
        Here is an example of one specific type of anchor - one built to overlay a physical window. This "window anchor"
        is shaped as a 2-D plane, in keeping
        with the idea that a see-through window is usable on either side. The window anchor has two unique behaviors to
        be controlled by CSS. The first is the ability to "flip"
        the AR content in order to reverse what AR content is being shown on each side of the window. The second unique
        behavior is to control if the window anchor is in fact double-sided, or if only one side of
        the plane should have active AR content.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container m1">
      <h3>Room Model</h3>
      <p>
        Now that a vision for control of an individual piece of AR content had been laid out, it was time to determine
        how this would translate to a "AR webpage" placed in the real world. Fortunately,
        previous research into "spatial AR" (Thomas et al. 2014) helped
        develop a concept. </p>
       
        <p>In the concept of spatial AR, all AR content in a physical space is anchored above flat surfaces such as tables.
        Placing AR objects near surfaces like these
        gives users specific locations and context that helps them understand how the AR object works.</p>
        
        <p>
        The Room Model merges the concept of spatial AR with the AR Container. Each AR Container has an <strong>anchor</strong>, a real-world object that the Container is placed near to.
        The AR Container system takes advantage of the physical affordances of an anchor to size itself approprietly.  For example, the surface above a table becomes a cube-shaped area that 
        content can be placed in.
        </p>

        <p>
          I developed a Photoshop mockup of how this Room Model might work:
        </p>

        <h4>Step 1:  Anchor Scan</h4>
        <p>The Room Model assume the existence of an <strong>object scanner</strong> - a
          computer vision component
          capable of recognizing real world objects that would make good anchors. In the first step of the Room Model process, the object
          scanner activates and begins scanning a user's room.</p>
      
            <figure href="/assets/RoomModel/css_prototype-01.jpg" class="figure" data-toggle="lightbox"
              data-footer="Room Model - Initial Object Scan">
              <img src="/assets/RoomModel/css_prototype-01.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
              <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Room Model - Initial Object Scan</figcaption>
            </figure>
        
            <p>This initial scan of the room establishes the overall dimensions of the room and establishes an overall area
              that AR content could be placed in.
              The overall Room Model functionality would then generate some base HTML representing the room.
            </p>
      

            <figure href="/assets/RoomModel/css_prototype-02.jpg" class="figure" data-toggle="lightbox"
              data-footer="Room Model - Establishing a Room">
              <img src="/assets/RoomModel/css_prototype-02.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
              <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Room Model - Establishing a Room</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h4>Step 2:  Generating Anchors</h4>
       
            <figure href="/assets/RoomModel/css_prototype-03.jpg" class="figure" data-toggle="lightbox"
              data-footer="Room Model - Detecting Possible Anchor Points">

              <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Room Model - Detecting Possible Anchor Points</figcaption>
            </figure>
        
  
        <p>In the next phase of the Room Model setup, the object scanner scans for potential anchor points that can be
          used as specific locations to place
          AR content. Within the overall room HTML, the Room Model then generates initial HTML for each anchor point it
          identifies.
        </p>
  
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-2"></div>
          <div class="col-8">
            <figure href="/assets/RoomModel/css_prototype-04.jpg" class="figure" data-toggle="lightbox"
              data-footer="Room Model - Established Room with Anchor Points Identified">
              <img src="/assets/RoomModel/css_prototype-04.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">

            </figure>
          </div>
          <div class="col-2"></div>
        </div>
  
        <p>The Room Model has now set up the room for AR content placement. Specific physical objects ripe for AR content
          have been
          identified. In addition, free space between physical objects that could also have AR objects placed in them are
          identified.
        </p>
  
        <h3>AR Containers Extended For The Room Model</h3>

        <p>Cube-shaped AR containers might not be the best shape to take advantage of some physical object shapes.  I therefore developed differently shaped AR Containers 
          strategically designed to cover a wide variety of physical objects:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Ceiling Container: Single large plane</li>
          <li>Poster Container: Smaller Plane</li>
          <li>Window Container: Double-sided plane</li>
          <li>Monitor Container: Single-sided plane designed for computer/TV screen coverage</li>
          <li>Table Container: Volumetric Cube hovering over the surface area of the table</li>
          <li>Light Source Container: Sphere that orbits the associated light source</li>
          <li>Free Space Container: Volumetric Cube between physical objects.</li>
        </ul>

      <p>

        Here is an example of one specific type of anchor - one built to overlay a physical window. This "window anchor"
        is shaped as a 2-D plane, in keeping
        with the idea that a see-through window is usable on either side. The window anchor has two unique behaviors to
        be controlled by CSS. The first is the ability to "flip"
        the AR content in order to reverse what AR content is being shown on each side of the window. The second unique
        behavior is to control if the window anchor is in fact double-sided, or if only one side of
        the plane should have active AR content.
        <br>

        To further demonstrate the window anchor concept, I built two demos in the Aframe Web-based VR standard.
        <br>
      </p>

      <h3>Photoshop Morkup</h3>
      <p>
        Now that I had developed a basic set of prototypes of how each individual piece of AR content could be
        controlled with CSS, it was time to
        look at prototyping how an entire room might be controlled intelligently. For this part of the ideation process,
        I built a set
        of Photoshop mockups to create an initial vision of how the Room Model might control a room, based on the
        underlying principles of spatial AR.
      </p>


      
      <div class="container m1"></div>
      <h3>Concept Demo</h3>
      <p>Now that the initial ideation has established the core concepts of the AR Cube and the Room Model, it was time
        to start moving towards more robust prototypes that moved
        towards real-world application. As the concept of using physics to actually control the interactions of AR
        objects had come up within the Room Model, developing a more functional physics-based interaction
        system was the next major goal.

      <h3>Pre-implementation Brainstorming - What Strategies can be used for Physics-based Layouts?</h3>
      <p>
        Before I starting developing the physics-based interaction system, I needed to have a stronger idea of what the
        end goal interactions might be.
        How would a physic-based system control the exact physical locations of AR content in a coherent way? What
        strategies could a physic-based layout control use? In particular,
        what strategies should be used when a set of AR content is moved from one room to another?
        After a round of brainstorming on potential solutions, I settled on 3 initial strategies for AR room layout
        control via physics - blackhole, location, and anchor-matching.
        To more fully-flesh out my paper-based brainstorming, I built an AFrame demo for each strategy, using, for the
        moment, canned animations rather than physics.

      <H4>Blackhole Strategy</H4>

        </video>
      </div>

      <p>
        The first physics-layout control strategy, "blackhole" revolves around the concept of a "master" object that's
        automatically placed in the center
        of a given room. When AR objects are moved into this room, the blackhole strategy pulls all AR objects to the
        center of the room. The blackhole strategy is used as a
        default or "safe" strategy, when there are enough unknowns that other strategies won't work. This strategy
        guaruntees an initially usable AR object layout, as it pulls
        all AR objects to a centralized location that will be accesible in most rooms. However, this stategy will never
        result in an ideal layout that's truly convenient for the user, and therefore
        should only be used as a fallback solution.

      <a href="https://aframecssextension.glitch.me/index_rm2_ps.html">Live Demo Link (Works best in Firefox)</a>
      <p>
        The second control strategy, "location" looks at how AR objects were positined in the users' previous room, and
        attempts to place the AR objects in the same
        spacially-relative position in the new room. This strategy would potentially work well for room tranfers where
        the rooms are of similar dimensions, but is otherwise
        the most limited of the three strategies.

      <p>
        The third strategy, "anchor matching", revolves around the concept of "anchors" that was previously defined in
        the Room Model. This strategies looks at what physical
        anchors each piece of AR content was connecting to in the original room. It then attempts to find a matching
        physical anchor to place the content near (i.e if an AR object was originally
        placed near a window, this strategy will attempt to find a window in the new room to place that AR object near
        to). This is the most interesting and potentially useful strategy,
        as it attempts to take the end-user context behind AR placement into account when switching rooms.

    <h2>Prototype</h2>
    <p>
      Discussion with of the physics-based layouts with my academic stakeholder lead to the decision to create a
      "physics playground" - a virtual environment in which
      we could test various physics-based layout strategies to find which ones worked well. I therefore educated myself
      on the methods AFrame uses to simulate physics, and then built a playground that my stakeholder
      could use to test various layout controls.

    <h3>Prototype Development</h3>
    <h4>Playground V1 - Freeform Controls</h4>

    <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
      <video class="embed-responsive-item" width="320" height="240" controls muted>
        <source src="/assets/RoomModel/RoomModel_Physic_playground_demo1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      </video>
    </div>

    <p>With this initial version of the playground, I attempted to build a freeform environment for adding simulated
      AR objects and
      building layouts. This demo has the following functionality:
      <ol>
        <li>The ability to add any number of simulated AR objects, with physics attached. Objects are adding with
          either a distance
          constraint (which maintains a constant distance between the object and the black sphere), or with a spring
          constraint (which adds an invisible spring with tension between the object and the black sphere.)
        </li>
        <li>The ability to turn the physics interactions on and off. This allows the user to turn physics off and
          manually adjust the position of AR objects. The physics can then be turned on to let physics forces manage
          the positions of AR objects.</li>
        <li>The ability to activate "Blackhole" mode. This functionility uses physics to pull all the AR objects from
          wherever they are to the black sphere, allows for easy AR layout cleanup.
          This functionality is a live, working version of the Blackhole animation-based demo discussed earlier.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Playground V2 - Initial Prebuilt Layout</h4>

      <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
        <video class="embed-responsive-item" width="320" height="240" controls muted>
          <source src="/assets/RoomModel/RoomModel_physics_playground_demo2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video>
      </div>

      <p>Version 2 added a prebuilt layout to show more discretly what a physics-based layout might look like. In this
        version,
        the two AR objects are tied together in a layout by touching them together. The demo detects collision between
        the two objects and attached them
        together via a physics "lock" constraint that sticks them together at the collision point. The two AR objects
        are then manipulated together as one.
      </p>

      <h4>Playground V3 - Complex Prebuilt Layout</h4>
      <a href="http://aframecssextension.glitch.me/index_superhands2.html">Live Demo Link (Works best in Firefox)</a>
      <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">

          <source src="/assets/RoomModel/RoomModel_Physics_Layout_demo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video>
      </div>

      <p>Version 3 utilizes a more complex layout scenario, with 8 separate AR objects. All physics interactions
        between the objects are activated
        by touching them together. The AR objects will attach themselves in a wide variety of ways, and one of the
        objects is even "squishable" (the object will be reduced in size
        every time it collides with another object.). This demo allows the user to test a variety of layout
        configurations without having to utilize the main control panel implemented in version 1.</p>

      <h3>Final Design Specification</h3>
      <p>The project now had models for three key components of AR object control: The AR Cube (how to control
        individual objects), the Room Model (how to control the entire room), and the Physic Model (how to control the
        direct interactions between objects). How do these models tie together back into the extension of CSS that was
        the original goal of the project? My final task in this project was to provide a final, merged model that
        answered this question. I called the final model "Physics CSS", and here's how it works: </p>

      <h3>Physics CSS Concepts - Core AR Object Properties</h3>
      <p>The Core AR Object Properties correspond to the AR Cube, in that they define the basic characteristics of an
        individual AR object. These basic properties are:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mass:</strong>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Positioning:</strong>

          <li><strong>Anchor Type:</strong> </li>
          <li><strong>Collision Type Property:</strong> </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-2"></div>
          <div class="col-8">
            <figure href="/assets/RoomModel/corecssmockup.PNG" class="figure" data-toggle="lightbox" data-footer="Example CSS Mockup code for the core definition of a
          Physic Model AR Object">
              <img src="/assets/RoomModel/corecssmockup.PNG" alt="" class="img-fluid">
              <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Example CSS Mockup code for the core definition of a
                Physic Model AR Object</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>
          <div class="col-2"></div>
        </div>
      </p>

      <h3>Mass</h3>
      <p>This numeric property corresponds roughly to specificity/importance in standard
        CSS, but much more
        granular. The more mass an
        AR object has, the more important it is in the overall layout. When collision/overall in AR objects occur,
        a master-servant relationship is established between the two objects
        to establish hierarchy. The object with the higher mass in the collision is designated the master. In
        addition, the mass could control other aspects of AR object interactions, such as the look-and-feel
        styling.
        An example, an object with a higher mass might reject attempts to overwrite its styling by a lower-mass
        object.</p>

      <h3>Positioning</h3>
      <p>This property is associated with the Room Layout strategies, and are used
        to determine when
        an AR object from one room is moved to a new physical space.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Blackhole:</strong> moves the AR object to a central location within the new room.
            Considered to be the
            “safe”
            option most likely to guarantee a working layout configuration.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Location</strong> moves the AR object in the new room to a location as relatively
            (proportionally) close
            to
            the object’s positioning in the original room.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Anchor Matching:</strong> AR object is moved to the physical room object that most closes
            matches the
            physical
            object the AR object was tied to in the original room:
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h3>AnchorType</h3>
      <p>
        This property incorporates and controls the "anchor" aspects of the Room Model. As part of the this model
        merger, I brainstormed out several additional anchor types:
        <ul>
          <li>Ceiling Anchor: Single large plane</li>
          <li>Poster Anchor: Smaller Plane</li>
          <li>Window Anchor: Double-sided plane</li>
          <li>Monitor Anchor: Single-sided plane designed for computer/TV screen coverage</li>
          <li>Table Anchor: Volumetric Cube hovering over the surface area of the table</li>
          <li>Light Source: Sphere that orbits the associated light source</li>
          <li>Free Space: Volumetric Cube between physical objects.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-2"></div>
        <div class="col-8">
          <figure href="/assets/RoomModel/ceilingcssmockup.PNG" class="figure" data-toggle="lightbox"
            data-footer="Example CSS Mockup code for the AnchorType CSS property.">

          </figure>
        </div>
        <div class="col-2"></div>
      </div>


      <h3>CollisionType</h3>
      <p>
        This property roughly corresponds to the border/margin property of the CSS box model, and incorporates the
        functionality
        from the Physics Playground. The goal of this property is to determine what behavior the object should
        display
        when collision with another object occurs. The possible behaviors are:
        <ul>
          <li>Lock: Objects stick together on the spot with no distance separation in-between.</li>
          <li>Distance: Stick Together, but at a pre-defined distance.</li>
          <li>Repel: Objects forcem themselves away from each other.</li>
          <li>Sqishiness: Instead of connection, this collision type enables resizing. When the objects collide,
            items
            with squishiness get smaller.</li>
          <li>Nothing: Objects don't build a connection. Physics forces via mass alone determine movement during
            collusion. Objects are not linked post-collision.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
