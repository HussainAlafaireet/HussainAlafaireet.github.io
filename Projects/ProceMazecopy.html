    <div class=project-intro-box>
      <p><strong>Role: </strong> UX Designer, Full-Stack Developer &nbsp;|&nbsp; <strong>Duration: </strong>4 Weeks
        <br>
        <strong>Tools Used: </strong>Unity Game Engine, SteamVR (for running the Maze on a VR headset)
        <br>
        <strong>UX Skills Used: </strong>VR Prototyping, Usability Testing, VR UX Design
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Summary: </strong> Virtual Reality presents a unique challenge for immersive experiences, as the user has the freedom to look in all directions at any time.  This freedom makes it
        possible for the user to be looking in the wrong place at the wrong time, and miss seeing key portions of the experience.  The VR Clues Maze is an experiment in directing attention within a VR maze.
        The VR Clues Maze generates a unique layout every time the software is run.  Dynamically added clues are then added to subtly direct the user out of the maze.

        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>My Contributions: </strong> As the AR Product Design Lead, <strong>I was the guiding light
        </strong> behind the AR Presenter
        prototype. I
        conducted stakeholder research to determine the real user needs, generated the interaction design for
        AR Presenter, and oversaw it's development cycle. Along the way, I introduced Fast Effect to the
        Interpretation
        Session and Affinity Wall user-centered design technique, as well as <strong>fostering an enhanced degree of
          ownership
          and
          teamwork within an interdisciplinary development team. </strong>

    <h2 class="text-center"><strong>Process</strong></h2>

    <div class="callout">
      <blockquote>The typical AR app performs badly in the trade show environment.</blockquote>
    </div>

    <p>I worked on behalf of Fast Effect with one of their pre-existing clients, a car technology manufacturer in the
      Detroit, MI area. The client had multiple Hololens wireless AR headsets, and had previously tried to perform
      product demonstrations with them
      via an AR app. The client had not been satisfied with the overall expereince of this previous app, and the
      Hololens had been underutilized ever since.
      <br>
      <br>
      My task was to determine the reasons for the disatisfaction, understand where the client wanted to next head with
      Augmented Reality, and design a solution for that new direction.

      <br>
      <br>
      Here's the process I used to arrive at AR Presenter:
    </p>

    <br>



    <h2>Explore</h2>
    <p>
      <h3>Stakeholder Interviews</h3>

      <div class="callout">
        <blockquote>The client needed an AR app that was visitor-friendly, easy to maintain, and venue-agnostic.
        </blockquote>
      </div>

      In order to understand the previous app history and it's corresponding effect on the stakeholder desires for a new
      app, I conducted a set of
      semi-structured stakeholder interviews. I interviewed the heads of the two client departments using the previous
      app: The head of R&D marketing, and the head of community outreach.
      With permission from the client, the interview's audio was recorded.
      <br>
      <br>


      <h3>Previous App Review</h3>
      <p>
        The Fast Effect development team had also observed the previous client team in action, and their overall observations
        overlapped significantly with the client observations.  In addition, the development team was able to provide technical explanations as to 
        why the issues observed had actually occured.  This would be of great help when I began the design process for AR Presenter, as I was able to avoid these technical
        challenges from the start.

      <h3> Client Walkthrough</h3>

      <p>At the end of the second week of sprints, we invited our two client stakeholders in to test our demo. We
        walked
        the client through our demo scenario and then allowed them to experiment with the menu system, voice chat, and shared AR object control.
      
        The client was pleased with the demo's capabilities, and authorized the creation of a full version of AR Presenter.

      <h3>Post-Demo Analysis</h3>
        
       However, even with this success, I still needed to assess the lessons learned from both the development and demonstration processes.  My analysis yielded the following insights:

            <p class="text-center">
              The client was particularly impressed with the demo's ability to have the presenter's actions immediately reflect on the presentee hologram.
              They quite clearly saw the power of AR Presenter as a controlled live experience.

              <p class="text-center">
                We had carefully sized the presentation controls to be easily usable via Hololens gestures, and placed the controls 
                so that the user could easily turn right to see them, without having them obscure the presentation content.  Client feedback
                on this arrangement was positive, confirming the correctness of the menu design.

                      We would need to offer a left-aligned menu as an option.

      <h3>Project Plan</h3>
      The final phase of my assignment was designing a project plan to govern the development of the full version of AR Presenter.  
      I suggested the full version be broken down into 3 main phases:

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Phase 1:  Demo clean-up and full presentation scenario:  </strong> In this phase, Fast Effect would implement the Standalone Mode, the Scaleable Holograms, and the Left-Handed Presentation Controls features.
        It would also work with the client to develop a full product demonstration scenario that the client could start using, even as the rest of the app was being developed.</li>
        <li><strong>Phase 2:  Parts Ecosystem Proof of Concept: </strong> In this phase, Fast Effect would develop all of the backend code required to support the Part Ecosystem, as well as developing a set of AR objects to demostrate 
        what this system could really do.</li>
        <li><strong>Phase 3:  "Safe Shared Environment" Finalization and Final UI Adjustments</strong>In this phase, Fast Effect would finalize the local network functionality required for the Safe Shared Experience Environment feature, 
        and would test this feature in an actual show venue.  Fast Effect would also use this phase to finalize any features that needed polish.</li>
      </ol>

      With this final deliverable, I had successfully completed my assignment.  Fast Effect and their client were well on 
      their way to developing a cutting-edge AR experience together.
