    <div class=project-intro-box>
      <p><strong>Role: </strong> UX Designer, Full-Stack Developer &nbsp;|&nbsp; <strong>Duration: </strong>4 Weeks
        <br>
        <strong>Tools Used: </strong>Unity Game Engine, SteamVR (for running the Maze on a VR headset)
        <br>
        <strong>UX Skills Used: </strong>VR Prototyping, Usability Testing, VR UX Design
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Summary: </strong> Virtual Reality presents a unique challenge for immersive experiences, as the user
        has the freedom to look in all directions at any time. This freedom makes it
        possible for the user to be looking in the wrong place at the wrong time, and miss seeing key portions of the
        experience.
        <br>
        <br>
        The VR Clues Maze is an immersive experience that balances user freedom and directed attention.
        The VR Clues Maze generates a unique layout every time the software is run. Dynamically added clues are then
        added to subtly direct the user out of the maze.

        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>My Contributions: </strong> I co-designed the design of the VR Clues Maze with my partner on this
        project, <a href="https://vladimirdesigns.me/">Vlad Potiyevskiy</a></strong>.
        As co-designer, I was responsible for overall look-and-feel, which was a "Japanese-style" haunted house theme. I
        defined the overall look, developed the lighting setup, and sourced the assets required
        to achieve this theme.
        <br>
        <br>
        I also acted as a developer on this project. In this role, I developed a pathfinding solution that could
        automatically
        find a path through the randomized maze. I then implemented a system to dynamically add clues around this path,
        providing the user guidance on how to get of the maze.

    <div class="callout">
      <blockquote>How can a virtual environment subtly, but effectively direct the users attention?</blockquote>
    </div>

    <p>
      My initial inspiration for this project was my experience with the <a
        href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1592039100813771/">Ghost in the Shell</a> VR app.
      The app plays out like a short movie, centering around a chaotic fight scene in a large room. What I noticed is
      that since the experience was in a 3-D space, and I had
      full ability to look in all directions, I would often miss key parts of the fight scene, due to looking at the
      wrong direction at the wrong time. This brought on the realization
      that VR experiences need some ability to effectively direct the users attention, while still allowing the users
      complete viewing freedom.
      <br>
      <br>
      The VR Clues Maze is a VR environment designed to direct the users attention, through lighting and subtle
      environment cues.

      <br>

    <h3>Brainstorming</h3>

    <div class="callout">
      <blockquote>Insert stuff here
      </blockquote>
    </div>

    <p>
        This project was occuring in the context of a design challenge with 4 weeks allowed for design and development.
        
        My partner and I had relatively free rein over the nature and content of the project, but we knew that scoping
        would be critical.
        We therefore made a substantial effort during our first brainstorming session to define the scope concretly, and
        to prioritize
        our feature set.

    <h3>Timeline</h3>
    <p>
      As our overall development window was quite short for a project this ambitious, Vlad and I designed a 
      timetable that would allow us to deliver a complete package, removing any features that proved too big a challenge.  Our timeline was as follows:
      <br>
      <br>
      Week 1:  Scoping.  We would explore the two main two main features that our app would be built on:  the random maze generation and the atmospheric lighting.  Success or failure in these 
      two areas would determine how feasible the overall project was.
      <br>
      <br>
      Weeks 2-3:  Iteration 1 and Initial User Test:  Once we determined if the main features were feasible, we would develop an initial version of our app.  At the end of this time period, we would run an initial walkthrough with other 
      users to assess the overall effectiveness of the maze and attention direction tools.
      <br>
      <br>
      Week 4:  Our final week would be spent adjusting the app based on the feedback from the initial user test, and performing any other polishing work needed for the 
      second (and final) demo.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h2>Scoping</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Technical Exploration</h3>
    
        <h4>Random Maze Generation</h4>
        <p>Vlad took on the task of exploring the Unity random maze tutorial, and bringing it into our VR environment.  The procedural maze source was sound, and we were able to implement the majority of the maze in VR without
          major issues.  The implementation initially treated the maze as a 2-D maze, generating a series of flat tiles.  The implementation then
          adds walls, doors, and wall hangings to create a 3-D maze.  My partner and I added additional wall and floor textures, as well as additional 
          wall decorations, to make the maze more resemble the theming we were going for.

          </div>
  
          <h4>Dynamic Clue System</h4>
          I began work on
          adding the dynamic lighting/clue system. First, I needed to design how this system would work. The system needed
          3 main components:
          <ul>
            <li>A designed set of clues that could be used to hint at the correct direction to get out of the maze.</li>
            <li>A system to determine the "path" the user should follow to get out of the maze.</li>
            <li>A system to be able to dynamically insert clues around that path to give hints to users about how to get
              to the exit.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
  
        <br>
        <h3>Initial Clue Design</h3>
        <p>I first began by creating the initial design for what form the clues should look. I had several ideas for how
          the clues might look, including
          lamps (in keeping with our theme about using lights as attention seekers), but also considered using some
          simulation of fireflies for a more organic indicator. I also considered using some sort of metallic design
          that wouldn't directly be a light source, but would catch the light from light sources.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, as we delved deeper into the procedural generation system we were using, the design constraint imposed
          by the system came more into play. The procedural generation system worked off of a sytem of "pre-fabs" - a
          series of collected walls, floors, wall hangings, and other objects that would
          be placed together as a unit. Whatever clue object I built would need to integrate with how the maze
          construction system worked.
          As the idea of lamp-based clues was strongest, I decided to try that route first. I began by tuning the ambient
          lighting environment within the maze by adding a sourced night-sky skybox,
          and adjusting the overall ambient lighting to allow the player to see, but not incredibly well. This lighting
          situation would cause our eventual light-based clues and player-interactable torches to have
          immediate value to the player. I then sourced a Japanese lantern model, and created a prefab with this model, a
          light source, and a wall. We then added this pre-fab to the procedural generation
          prefab list, which then seeded the maze with procedurally generated lighting.
        </p>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-2"></div>
          <div class="col-8">
            <figure href="/assets/ProcMaz/proc_maze_lantern_shot.PNG" class="figure" data-toggle="lightbox"
            data-footer="Initial Lantern Prefab">

          </div>
          <div class="col-2"></div>
        </div>
  
        <p>It occurred to me as I built the initial lamps that a more subtle way to handle adding clues was to add then to
          maze elements that would already be present. I had sourced a Japanese Oni mask as part of a more generic
          wall prefab that we were using to establish a Japanese theme for the maze. I decided to combine the mask with
          the lantern prefab to create a clue. I created a new version of the lantern pre-fab identical to the original
          one,
          but with the exeception of having a tiny version of the Japanese Mask now embedded in it's side. The intent was
          to place these "clue" lanterns in and admist the randomly-generated one, but place these lanterns in the
          direction the player
          should go to get out of the maze.
