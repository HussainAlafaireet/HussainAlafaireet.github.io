    <div class=project-intro-box>
      <p><strong>Role: </strong> UX Designer, Full-Stack Developer &nbsp;|&nbsp; <strong>Duration: </strong>4 Weeks
        <br>
        <strong>Tools Used: </strong>Unity Game Engine, SteamVR (for running the Maze on a VR headset)
        <br>
        <strong>UX Skills Used: </strong>VR Prototyping, Usability Testing, VR UX Design
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Summary: </strong> Virtual Reality presents a unique challenge for immersive experiences, as the user
        has the freedom to look in all directions at any time. This freedom makes it
        possible for the user to be looking in the wrong place at the wrong time, and miss seeing key portions of the
        experience.
        <br>
        <br>
        The VR Clues Maze is an immersive experience that balances user freedom and directed attention.
        The VR Clues Maze generates a unique layout every time the software is run. Dynamically added clues are then
        added to subtly direct the user out of the maze.

        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>My Contributions: </strong> I co-designed the design of the VR Clues Maze with my partner on this
        project, <a href="https://vladimirdesigns.me/">Vlad Potiyevskiy</a></strong>.
        As co-designer, I was responsible for overall look-and-feel, which was a "Japanese-style" haunted house theme. I
        defined the overall look, developed the lighting setup, and sourced the assets required
        to achieve this theme.
        <br>
        <br>
        I also acted as a developer on this project. In this role, I developed a pathfinding solution that could
        automatically
        find a path through the randomized maze. I then implemented a system to dynamically add clues around this path,
        providing the user guidance on how to get of the maze.

    <div class="callout">
      <blockquote>How can a virtual environment subtly, but effectively direct the users attention?</blockquote>
    </div>

    <p>
      My initial inspiration for this project was my experience with the <a
        href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1592039100813771/">Ghost in the Shell</a> VR app.
      The app plays out like a short movie, centering around a chaotic fight scene in a large room. What I noticed is
      that since the experience was in a 3-D space, and I had
      full ability to look in all directions, I would often miss key parts of the fight scene, due to looking at the
      wrong direction at the wrong time. This brought on the realization
      that VR experiences need some ability to effectively direct the users attention, while still allowing the users
      complete viewing freedom.
      <br>
      <br>
      The VR Clues Maze is a VR environment designed to direct the users attention, through lighting and subtle
      environment cues.

    <p>
      This project was occuring in the context of a design challenge with 4 weeks allowed for design and development.

      My partner and I had relatively free rein over the nature and content of the project, but we knew that scoping
      would be critical.
      We therefore made a substantial effort during our first brainstorming session to define the scope concretly, and
      to prioritize
      our feature set.

    <h3>Timeline</h3>
    <p>
      As our overall development window was quite short for a project this ambitious, Vlad and I designed a
      timetable that would allow us to deliver a complete package, removing any features that proved too big a
      challenge. Our timeline was as follows:
      <br>
      <br>
      Week 1: Scoping. We would explore the two main two main features that our app would be built on: the random maze
      generation and the atmospheric lighting. Success or failure in these
      two areas would determine how feasible the overall project was.
      <br>
      <br>
      Weeks 2-3: Iteration 1 and Initial User Test: Once we determined if the main features were feasible, we would
      develop an initial version of our app. At the end of this time period, we would run an initial walkthrough with
      other
      users to assess the overall effectiveness of the maze and attention direction tools.
      <br>
      <br>
      Week 4: Our final week would be spent adjusting the app based on the feedback from the initial user test, and
      performing any other polishing work needed for the
      second (and final) demo.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h2>Scoping</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Technical Exploration</h3>

    <h4>Random Maze Generation</h4>
    <p>Vlad took on the task of exploring the Unity random maze tutorial, and bringing it into our VR environment. The
      procedural maze source was sound, and we were able to implement the majority of the maze in VR without
      major issues. The implementation initially treated the maze as a 2-D maze, generating a series of flat tiles. The
      implementation then
      adds walls, doors, and wall hangings to create a 3-D maze. My partner and I added additional wall and floor
      textures, as well as additional
      wall decorations, to make the maze more resemble the theming we were going for.

      <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">

          allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      </div>

      <h4>Dynamic Clue System</h4>
      I began work on
      adding the dynamic lighting/clue system. First, I needed to design how this system would work. The system needed
      3 main components:
      <ul>
        <li>A designed set of clues that could be used to hint at the correct direction to get out of the maze.</li>
        <li>A system to determine the "path" the user should follow to get out of the maze.</li>
        <li>A system to be able to dynamically insert clues around that path to give hints to users about how to get
          to the exit.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>I first began by creating the initial design for what form the clues should look. I had several ideas for how
      the clues might look, including
      stone lamps, fireflies, and light-reflecting metallic shapes.
    </p>



    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-2"></div>
      <div class="col-8">

          data-footer="Brainstorming Clue System">
          <img src="/assets/ProcMaz/p_initial clues.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">

      </div>
      <div class="col-2"></div>
    </div>



    <p>

      As the idea of lamp-based clues was the idea that I had come up with first, I decided to try that route first. I
      began by tuning the ambient
      lighting environment within the maze by adding a sourced night-sky skybox,
      and adjusting the overall ambient lighting to be a little dim. These adjustments allowed the user to see, but not
      incredibly well. This lighting
      situation would cause our eventual light-based clues and player-interactable torches to have
      immediate value to the player. I then sourced a Japanese lantern model, and created a maze module with this model,
      a
      light source, and a wall. We then added this module to the list of modules the random maze generator would use.
      Now, our maze would have lamps randomly-placed to provide
      a level of lighting support for the player.
    </p>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-2"></div>
      <div class="col-8">
        <figure href="/assets/ProcMaz/proc_maze_lantern_shot.PNG" class="figure" data-toggle="lightbox"
          data-footer="Initial Lantern Module">
          <img src="/assets/ProcMaz/proc_maze_lantern_shot.PNG" alt="" class="img-fluid">
          <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Initial Lantern Module
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
      <div class="col-2"></div>
    </div>

    <p>Now that we had lamps integrated into the maze, I needed to find a way to make the lamps "clues" to guide the
      player out.
      It occurred to me as I built the initial lamps that a more subtle way to handle adding clues was to use design
      elements that were already present, but in new ways.
      I had sourced a Japanese Oni mask as part of a more generic
      wall module that we were using to establish a Japanese theme for the maze. I decided to combine the mask with
      the lantern prefab to create a clue. I created a new version of the lantern module identical to the original
      one,
      but with the exeception of having a tiny version of the Japanese Mask now embedded in it's side. The intent was
      to place these "clue" lanterns in addition to the random ones. While seeming random, these "clue" lanterns would
      actually be placed in the direction the user should go to get out of the maze.

    <h3>Assessment</h3>
    <p>At the end of the technical exploration phase, Vlad and I assessed our status, and we rescoped the project. We
      had touched on most of the primary features we had isolated in our
      ideation phase, leaving only the Maze-Finding component of the Dynamic Clue System feature and the Player
      Interactions feature as unknowns. Our plan was to iterate to a full Version 1 of the Maze, with each one of us
      building out the rest of the two remaining features. Vlad took on the Player Interactions component, while I took
      on the Maze-Finding component.
    </p>

    <h2>Iteration</h2>

    <h3>Iteration 1</h3>


    <p>Now that I had the visual design of a clue worked out, it was time to figure out how to place it. In order to
      intelligently
      In order to know where to place the clues, I would need to know where the optimal path was for each generated
      maze.
      This necessitated the need for a mazefinding algorithm I could run to find a path out, just after the
      maze was generated.
      I looked into several prexisting algorithms, such as <a
        href="http://www.primaryobjects.com/2013/05/13/solving-mazes-with-ai-pathfinding-techniques-a-vs-tremaux/">Tremaux's</a>
      and <a href="http://traceymccabe.com/maze-solving/">Pledge's</a>, and tested an implementation
      of Pledge's in the Maze. However, these algorithms - they only
      worked for "simple" mazes that have only corridors. Our maze could generate small courtyard-style open spaces,
      and Pledge's failed when hitting one of those locations.
      <br>
      <br>
      Going back to the drawing board, I decided to try using <a
        href="https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html">breadth-first search</a>, as this
      algorithm was capable of handling the courtyard spaces.
      I was
      able to find several existing implementations of it for tile mazes, including one by
      the <a href="https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/hex-map/part-16/">same individual that had developed the
        procedural maze code we were using</a>. Based on these implementations, I was able to create an implementation
      of my own,
      scanning the tiles in the Maze, and marking the tiles that lead to the exit by changing their colors.

    <p>Now that I had a system with which to mark the path, I could start adding clues to mark the path, rather than
      the rather obvious color I was doing for debug purposes.
      The algorithm I developed for adding the path stepped through each tile on the path, and performed two
      actions:
      <ul>
        <li>The algorithm checked to see if the tile was a "third tile" - every third tile on the path was a candidate
          for placing a clue This would add just enough clues to be useful, without making the Maze too easy to get out
          of.</li>
        <li>If the tile was in fact a "third" tile, the algorithm would check to see if the tile in question had a wall.
          If so, the algorithm replaced it with a wall that had a clue-lantern near it.</li>
      </ul>

      The algorithm was deployed just after the initial procedural generation, and would add the clue lanterns just
      before the user was able to exploring the maze.

    <h3>Initial User Testing </h3>

    <p>
      As planned, we tested our Version 1 on users to gain initial feedback. We tested with 3 users, also participated
      in the design challenge. Testing consisted of undirected
      use of the Maze, with users playing the Maze on Rift headsets, giving feedback as they played. The user view was
      accessible via a separate monitor, which allowed for direct observation in
      addtion to feedback.
      <br>
      <br>
      Our users had varying levels of VR background, but all had been trained in basic VR design best practices, which
      allowed them to give a strong mix of user/expert feedback.
      <br>
      <h4>User Feedback</h4>

          <ul>
            <li>Users cited the lamps as the primary navigation aids they used to understand the maze structure.</li>
            <li>This use confirmed the decision to use the lamps as the focus for the clue system.</li>

          <h4 class="text-center"><small>Users Were Easily Disorientated</small></h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Users became easily disorientated when explored the maze.</li>
            <li>Diorientation due to 4 design factors:

                <li>
                  Floor textures were the same throughout the maze.

          <ul>
            <li>Users navigated the maze with a least-explored strategy, always attempting to go where they had not
              been before..</li>
            <li>This strategy only had limited success, as users were not able to tell easily where they had been.

          <ul>
            <li>Users stated a need to build an internal mental map of how the Maze was laid out, and were frustrated
              that this desire was not supported well by the app.</li>
            <li>Users stressed the need to have "safe" landmarks to fall back on.</li>

    <h3>Iteration 2</h3>

    <p>For our final iteration, Vlad and I tried to address as many of the feedback points as possible, as well as
      adding two minor features for greater user enjoyment.</p>

    <br>
    <h4>Iteration 2 Changes</h4>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-4">

        </figure>
        <h4 class="text-center"><small>Additional Clue Type</small></h4>
        <p>To address the need for more clues, we needed a clue type that could cover candidate spaces without walls. I
          created a module that
          contained a floor
          tile with a metal cube buried into it, and a faint light source positioned just above it to help the cube
          catch the light. I also increased the frequence of clues to every other tile.</p>

      <div class="col-4">

        </figure>
        
        <h4 class="text-center"><small>End of User Celebration Area</small></h4>
        <p>I added a script to the end tile that would "teleport" the player to a separate area outside of the maze upon
          entry. I then added a Japanese-theme celebration area, with a sourced cherry-blossam tree, custom particle
          effects, and sources fire-fly themed Japanese lanterns.</p>

      <div class="col-4">

          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h4 class="text-center"><small>Overhead View Implementation</small></h4>
        <p>We demoed the game using the Unity editor directly, and we noticed an interesting beheavior from our players
          (and ourselves). The Unity editor was set up to show an overhead view of the scene, which we had used for
          debugging purposes. However, demo-goers not wearing the headset were able to view the active player's position
          on the overhead view, and were able to guide the active player through the maze. We thought this was an
          interesting optional feature, and wanted to formally add it to the game.</p>

        </figure>
        <h4 class="text-center"><small>Tutorial Area</small></h4>
        <p>My partner added an initial tutorial zone that the player enters prior to the maze itself. This tutorial area
          had instructions for playr controls, the goal of finding the end tiles, player interactables, and looking for
          clues.</p>

        <h4 class="text-center"><small>Player Light</small></h4>
        <p> I added a dim light to the player module in the maze. This creates a small but constant light source that
          ensures the player can always see enough to navigate the maze.</p>

    <h3>Post-Demo Analysis</h3>
    <br>


    <div class="row">

        <img src="/assets/FE_Internship/Icons/verified.png" alt="" class="mx-auto d-block img-fluid">
        <h4 class="text-center"><small>Improved Maze Navigation</small></h4>
        <p class="text-center">
          With the addition of the breadcrumbs, lighting, and additional clues, our users were able to navigate our maze
          far easier than Iteration 1. They were able
          to backtrack far easier, and reached the end of the maze with far more frequency.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-4">
        <img src="/assets/FE_Internship/Icons/verified.png" alt="" class="mx-auto d-block img-fluid">
        <h4 class="text-center"><small>The Overview Map allowed for a fun optional experience.</small></h4>
        <p class="text-center">
          With the use of the overview map, we were able to add a second user as a helper to the experience. Users
          enjoyed the interplay between user and helper. The presence of the helper
          allowed users with weaker navigation skills to still enjoy the overall experience.
        </p>

      <div class="col-4">

        <h4 class="text-center"><small>The Celebration Experienece Brought Proper Closure To The Experience.</small>
        </h4>
        <p class="text-center">
          With the celebration area, users had a clear feedback mechanism for telling that they had succeeded. The
          aesthestic design of the area also made it a fun reward for the users.

        <h4 class="text-center"><small>Clue Attention Direction</small></h4>
        <p class="text-center">
          The clues remained of only limited use. While the greater frequency made them more likely to be noticed, the
          visual design was too subtle. Some users picked up on them,
          but some never recognized them at all.
        </p>
      </div>


      <div class="col-4">

        <h4 class="text-center"><small>Users Wanted More Interactions/Interesting Environments</small></h4>
        <p class="text-center">
          Users who didn't find the maze exit relatively quickly tended to become bored with experience, once the
          novelty value had worn off. These users
          suggested having more interesting environment features (such as ponds and gardens) and activities to do (such
          as doors to unlocks, and people to talk to). We had
          ended up not included those features due to feasibility concerns, but their absence was noticed.

      <h3>Potential Next Steps</h3>

      <p>My partner and I were pretty pleased on how the project turned out, but we are considering taking it further.
        We'd like to test
        the clue improvments made with further users, and continue working on the clue design and placement algorithm
        based on this feedback.
        We would also like to improve the look and feel of the maze, by modifying the pre-fabs to make the maze look
        more like an actual mansion. Finally,
        we'd like to add more player interaction, and give players other activities to do besides just navigating the
        maze.</p>
