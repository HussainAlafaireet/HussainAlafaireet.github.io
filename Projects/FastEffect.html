    <h2>Project Summary</h2>

    <p>I joined Fast Effect, a creative media content company in Royal Oak, Michigan, as an AR Project/Design lead
      intern in the summer
      of 2018. Over the course of my internship, I oversaw the development of a prototype Augmented Reality presention
      software known as
      <strong>AR Presenter</strong>. This software was designed to allow tech company representatives to give stable
      AR-based product presentations, even in venues that
      are crowded, loud, have poor lighting, and low-internet connectivity. My main accomplishments over the course of
      this internship were:

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Scoping the project from the ground up.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Conducting a Stakeholder Analysis to assess client needs.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Introducing Fast Effect to multiple User-Centered Design techniques.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Developing the interaction design for an AR application.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Managing 2 design/development sprints to develop a prototype of said AR application.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Sucessfully demoing the application to the client, and receiving authorization to continue
            development.</strong></li>
      </ul>


    </p>

    <h2>Project Outcome</h2>
    <h3>AR Presenter</h3>

    <p>
      This project produced "AR Presenter": a Hololens-based augmented reality application designed to facilitate the
      trade/tech show experience. At the highest level, the product mimics the paradigm of Powerpoint, in that it allows
      presenters to build a "presentation" out of individual components, which can then be presented to
      viewers in a controlled manner. However, in this product, the "slides" are AR objects with triggerable
      interactions, and the "presentation" is a curated list AR objects that the presenter can switch between at will.
      The presenter has a "presenter"
      version of the AR Presenter app controls the experience, with the presentee Hololens mirroring the
      presenter-triggered changes.

      <h4>AR Presenter Features</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Adaptive Location Selection: </strong>In order to navigate a potentially confusing trade/tech show
          environment, the presenter has the option
          of placing a "marker" hologram to designate the physical location that best suits the presentation at hand.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Controlled Presenter Experience: </strong>While in presentation mode, the presenter has full control
          over the experience,
          with the ability to switch between pieces of AR content, and the ability to trigger specific interactions on
          them, which are then reflected in the presentee view in real-time.</li>
        <li><strong>Standalone Mode: </strong>In situations where a presenter isn't available, presentations can be run
          in
          a "standalone" mode, with presentees able to use
          simplified versions of the presenter controls to walk through the experience.</li>
        <li><strong>"Parts" Ecosystem: </strong>The presentation system is modular. The AR Presenteer app has a
          dedicated
          mode for building presentations, utilizing a library
          of AR content that can be expanded as needed.</li>
        <li><strong>"Safe" Shared Experience Environment: </strong>Many trade show and other outreach environments has
          factors that interfere
          with the shared experiences as originally envisoned by Microsoft. Room scanning is disrupted by abrupt changes
          in venue space, poor lighting,
          or simply high traffic flow (which can trick the Hololens into that the layout of the room has changed). AR
          Presenter utilizes a sharing experience revolving
          around a local wireless router packaged with the system, married to a single shared anchor placed when the
          presentation is started. This ensures a usable
          shared experience even in crowded venue spaces.</li>
      </ul>

    </p>

    <h4>Main Presenter Experience</h4>

    </div>

    <p>The core of the AR Presenter experience is the presenter-led scenario. In this scenario, Max, a presenter from
      car technology
      manufacturer "Company M" is giving a presentation on a new car componenet system. Max and his
      presentees are
      all wearing Hololens. Max starts by activating the "presenter" version of the AR Presenter app on their
      Hololens unit. Upon
      startup, Max can then use the Hololens "tap to place" gesture to place a starting hologram at the
      desired location where the presentation will
      take place. The placement of this hologram initites the presentation session, creating a shared world anchor, and
      transmitting that
      anchor to the presentee Hololens units via a shared local network packaged with the app. The presentees can now
      see the hologram at the same location
      Max has placed it.
    </p>

    </div>

    <p>Continuing on with the presenter scenario, Max is now in the presentation proper. He is presented with a view of
      the car
      hologram he will be demoing, and has controls that let him control it. Max can use the main presentation bar in
      the bottom-middle
      of his view to switch between AR objects. Max can then use the secondary "interactions" menu in the bottom-right
      to trigger pre-built
      interactions. In this case, Max has hit the "Animate" button to trigger the yellow "radar" interaction.
    </p>

      <div class="col-1"></div>
    </div>

    <p>The presentees then see the radar animation played out on their view. In the standard presentation mode,
      presentees can only
      view AR presentations as the presenter controls them. Presentees have one menu option however - in the event that
      their app
      unexpectedly disconnects from the shared presentation, the presentee has a reconnect button to allow them to reset
      the sharing functionality and
      reconnect them to the presentation.</p>



    <h2>Problem To Be Solved</h2>
    <p>I worked on behalf of Fast Effect with one of their pre-existing clients, a car technology manufacturer in the
      Detroit, MI area. The client's problem was that it had purchased multiple Hololens units for use to demonstrate
      their
      products, primarily in a trade and tech show environment. In a forward-thinking effort, the client had purchased
      a
      number of Hololens units, and had previously asked Fast Effect
      to develop a directed tech show experience. This experience while interesting, had some issues and the
      Hololens units had been underutilized ever since.
      <br>
      <br>
      My task was to determine the reasons for the failure, understand where the client wanted to next head with
      Augmented Reality, and design a solution for that new direction.
    </p>



    <h2>My Contribution</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Stakeholder Analysis</h3>
    <p>
      I had a surprising (and enticing) level of freedom on this project, as the nature and scope of the project had
      not been defined when I joined Fast Effect. To provide this clarity, I first held stakeholder interviews with
      the
      client. I
      interviewed two primary stakeholders: the client's head of R&D marketing, and the head of community outreach.
      These interviews were held
      in a "contextual inquiry" manner, without a strict adherance to the interview protocol. This allows me to
      explore
      a wide range of topics related
      to the client's use and vision for augmented reality. With permission from the client, the interview's audio was
      recorded.
      <br>
      <br>
      Once the interviews were complete, I introduced Fast Effects to the concepts of <strong>interpretation
        sessions</strong>
      and <strong>affinity walls</strong>. Previously at the company, the interview results would be informally
      reviewed
      by the company principles,
      and passed on to the technical team over time. However, for this project, I gathered the technical team to
      review
      the stakeholder interview directly. This proved to
      be a fruitful decision, as the combination of expertise allowed us to pull far more insight from the interview
      notes than we would have otherwise. We assembled these insights
      into a series of affinity notes.
      <br>
      <br>
      Once the notes were completed, I lead the technical team in the creation of an affinity wall. From this affinity
      wall, we
      derived <strong>4 design principles</strong> that guided the entire project from that point:
      <ol>
        <li><strong>A controlled, easy-to-use experience was paramount for the client AR app:</strong>
          The interviews revealed the previous AR app, while designed for trade/tech shows, had been repurposed as an
          outreach solution for
          student recruitment. This lead to the prospect that the new AR app would need to support a wide user base
          who
          possesed varying levels
          of AR expertise. In addition, both the tech show and outreach environments required high vistor throughput,
          which didn't leave time for even basic
          vistor training on app use. To navigate this client base, the application would need to be simple for the
          end-user to navigate, and highly-controllably by the client
          in order to guaruntee a controlled, positive experience.
        </li>
        <li><strong>The client app should be a setup-free application that has minimal environment
            requirements:</strong>The primary point for this insight was that the client had virtually no in-house
          expertise in maintaining
          Hololens applications. Fast Effect had previously handled all aspects of deployment and maintenance during
          the
          initial AR app deployment,
          ,but the client had then used the app on its own, encountering multiple technical challenges, such poor
          lighting
          conditions, limited wireless access, and disrupted spatial tracking. Any solution we developed
          would need to ensure that the client could negotiate these challenges with minimal expertise.</li>
        <li><strong>The client has a variety of use cases for AR/VR tech as a whole, with some use cases more
            developed
            than
            others:</strong>This insights relates to the various views within the client organization regarding AR
          technology. The marketings and outreach
          departments were already onboard with the use of AR technology as a method of promoting the client
          organization
          as a technology company first, and a manufacturing
          one second. However, many of the technical subject matter experts within the company, whose expertise would
          eventually be provide product specifications, had significant
          reservations about the use of AR. Fast Effect needed to be aware of these internal pressures as it built the
          application.</li>
        <li><strong>The client app should be composed of parts that can be put together to tell an overall
            story:</strong>Throughout the entire
          stakeholder interview, the concept of a narrative was a central thread. This need manefisted itself in
          several
          ways. The client wanted to portray itself as forward-thinking, and wanted to use
          AR technology to "wow and dazzle" those who didn't know much about the client. The selection of the Hololens
          as
          a platform was built on this basis, as it boasted a futuristic-looking design, was not tethered, and was not
          isolating. However, the client did want the capability to create multiple narratives. During the interview,
          we
          provided the intial suggestion of "building" a presentation
          out of "parts", similar to how a car is constructed. The client took an immediate liking to this idea, even
          suggest a particular upcoming car
          technology system that could be used to prototype the modular approach.</li>
      </ol>

      <br>
      Based on these insights, I developed four further recommendations to additional guide further design and
      development:
      <br>
      <br>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Use only proven AR tracking technologies and avoid approaches that require the use of room-wide
            spacial
            mapping:</strong> The stakeholders revealed that we could not count on our client having access to a
          pre-defined, well-lit, stable venue environment to run a Hololens solution in. Based on this, we knew not to
          rely on
          room-wide spatial scans to trigger AR content. Instead, we knew to use Image and Model Targets as our
          primary
          triggers, or possibly some local, temporary location spatial anchors at certain specified locations.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid targeting specific show venue designs, and instead develop generic solutions that work in
            either
            desktop or wall-mounted modes:</strong> This was another recommendation based on the lack of defined,
          stable
          venues for the client app to run in. I recommended following up with the client to determine a minimum
          amount of
          desk and wall-mounted space to support an app environment, and then build packaged versions of the app to
          target
          those sizes.</li>
        <li><strong>Further with the client to come up with a distinct target audience and a coherent
            message:</strong>As
          revealed by Insight #3, our client did not have an overall vision for its use of AR/VR tech, even within the
          public awareness sphere. One of the primary risks for the project is trying to satisfy so many potential
          stakeholders at the client organization that we wouldn't satisfy any of them to an acceptable degree. I
          recommended that we work further with the client to define a tight message and limited target user scope for
          the
          initial application.</li>
        <li><strong>Build a modular storytelling approach into the upcoming app.</strong> While we could, and should
          limit
          the scope of the message and target audience for the application this summer, that does not mean we couldn't
          think ahead to some degree for future messaging and purpose. I recommended building a generic data structure
          backend that allows us to associate individual modules with a larger story. This data structure could then
          be
          adapted to serve other client needs at a rapid pace.</li>
      </ol>



    </p>
    <h3>Ideation and Interaction Design</h3>
    <h4>Persona Development</h4>
    <p>Now that we had our initial set of application criteria completed, it was time to start ideating to determine
      the
      form that the application should take.
      I began by developing personas based on our two known client users: trade show presenters and outreach
      presenters. I
      developed
      a persona for each user type. These personas were then used to ground all future brainstorming session. Paper
      copies
      were also kept near the technical
      team's working space to remind it of who our users were, and what their needs really were.</p>

            needs.</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
      <div class="col-2"></div>
    </div>

    <h4>Brainstorming</h4>

    <p>After persona development, I once again gathered the technical team and facilitated a brainstormed session. The
      first phase
      of the session was completely free-form, with the intent to generate as many ideas as possible, without
      immediate
      worry of feasibility (a fact that I
      had to repeatedly remind the participants of, as the session progressed). Once we had hashed out an initial set
      of
      ideas, we discussed them more in-depth. We had several front-runner ideas emerging,
      including an AR scavenger hunt, a virtual visitation with a 3-D model of a client engineer, an "innovation
      timeline"
      (involving a virtual car that would change based on the client's innovations over the years), and the guided
      presentation experience that
      ended up becoming AR Presenter. Out of these ideas, the guided experience seemed to be the front-runner, as it
      aligned most directly with the
      insights and recommendations developed during the stakeholder analysis. Fast Effect's principles concurred with
      our
      selection of the guided experience.</p>
    <br>


    <h4>Interaction Design</h4>
    <p>
      Thanks to the brainstorming, we had a solid initial idea, but we didn't have enough specifics to go to the
      client. I
      therefore worked out the overall
      interaction design for the application. I built an initial set of interaction design sketches that outline the
      main
      interaction areas of the application:

    <h4>Client Pitch and Feedback</h4>
    <p>After the initial interaction design had been worked out, it was time to present the AR Presenter concept to the client.
      I prepared a pitch presentation deck, which included the main insights we had learned from the Stakeholder Analysis, mockups of the primary views in the 
      application, and both a short-term plan (to develop an initial prototype), and a long-term plan (to develop secondary features an an ecoysystem of AR content).
      <br>
      The client was overall pleased with the AR Presenter concept, and authorized the creation of an initial prototype.  The client also provided additional Feedback
      on the concept, which was incorporated into the planning for the initial prototype.
    </p>


    <h3>Development and Demo</h3>

    <h4>Prototyping Development Planning</h4>
    <p>My next task was to plan the development cycle for the intial AR prototype.  We had committed to having the prototype in two weeks.  With help 
    from my company mentor, I developed plans for two one-week sprints.  These sprints were broken down by functional area, with Graphic Design, Application Development, and 3-D Artist
    each receiving tasks.  My role within the sprints was two-fold.  I acted as overall project/design lead, with final say over any design decisions that needed to be made during the sprints.
    I also acted as a secondary application developer, assisting the primary developer on the creation of the core application functinality.

    Once I had developed a plan, I held a kick-off meeting with the technical team to present the client feedback and sprint plan.  Having this formal meeting ensured that 
    all members of the technical team were on the same page, and gave them a venue to check the feasibility of the sprint plan and ask for any additional resources they needed.  
    Providing this venue was a good move, as the primary developer requested from me a further breakdown of the application design, with more granualar steps than the initial set of design sketches.
    I provided this breakdown as my initial task during the sprint.</p>
