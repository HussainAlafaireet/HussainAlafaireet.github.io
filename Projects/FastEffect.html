      <h1>AR Presenter - Product Demonstration Enhanced</h1>

      <h2>Project Overview - AR for the Trade Show Environment</h2>

      <p>AR Presenter, developed by Fast Effect in Summer 2018, is a Hololens-based Augmented Reality software used to
        demonstrate products in trade/tech show
        venues. AR Presenter uses a careful combination of local-area location sharing, simplified presenter control,
        and
        modular AR presentation construction to defeat the the problems typical AR products face when used in the show
        environment.</p>

      <h2>My Contributions - Researcher, Designer, Leader</h2>
      <p>As an AR Product Design Lead at Fast Effect, I acted as the guiding light behind the AR Presenter prototype. I
        conducted stakeholder research to determine the real user needs, generated the interaction design for
        AR Presenter, and oversaw it's development cycle. Along the way, I introduced Fast Effect to the Interpretation
        Session and Affinity Wall user-centered design technique, as well as fostering an enhanced degree of ownership
        and
        teamwork within an interdisciplinary development team.</p>

      <h2>Problem To Be Solved - 30 Hololenses and Nothing to Do With Them</h2>
      <p>I worked on behalf of Fast Effect with one of their pre-existing clients, a car technology manufacturer in the
        Detroit, MI area. The client's problem was that it had purchased multiple Hololens units for use to demonstrate
        their
        products, primarily in a trade and tech show environment. In a forward-thinking effort, the client had purchased
        a
        number of Hololens units, and had previously asked Fast Effect
        to develop a directed tech show experience. This experience while interesting, had some issues and the
        Hololens units had been underutilized ever since.
        <br>
        <br>
        My task was to determine the reasons for the failure, understand where the client wanted to next head with
        Augmented Reality, and design a solution for that new direction.
      </p>



      <h2>Stakeholder Analysis What do you REALLY want?</h2>
      <p>
        I had a surprising (and enticing) level of freedom on this project, as the nature and scope of the project had
        not been defined when I joined Fast Effect. To provide this clarity, I first held stakeholder interviews with
        the
        client. I
        interviewed two primary stakeholders: the client's head of R&D marketing, and the head of community outreach.
        These interviews were held
        in a "contextual inquiry" manner, without a strict adherance to the interview protocol. This allows me to
        explore
        a wide range of topics related
        to the client's use and vision for augmented reality. With permission from the client, the interview's audio was
        recorded.
        <br>
        <br>
        Once the interviews were complete, I introduced Fast Effects to the concepts of <strong>interpretation
          sessions</strong>
        and <strong>affinity walls</strong>. Previously at the company, the interview results would be informally
        reviewed
        by the company principles,
        and passed on to the technical team over time. However, for this project, I gathered the technical team to
        review
        the stakeholder interview directly. This proved to
        be a fruitful decision, as the combination of expertise allowed us to pull far more insight from the interview
        notes than we would have otherwise. We assembled these insights
        into a series of affinity notes.
        <br>
        <br>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-6">
            <figure class="figure">
              <img src="/assets/FE_Internship/affinity_wall_during.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
              <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">The team building out the affinity notes</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>
          <div class="col-6">
            <figure class="figure">
              <img src="/assets/FE_Internship/affinity_wall_after.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
              <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">The completed affinity wall.</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>
        </div>

        Once the notes were completed, I lead the technical team in the creation of an affinity wall. From this affinity
        wall, we
        derived <strong>4 design principles</strong> that guided the entire project from that point:
        <ol>
          <li><strong>A controlled, easy-to-use experience was paramount for the client AR app:</strong>
            The interviews revealed the previous AR app, while designed for trade/tech shows, had been repurposed as an
            outreach solution for
            student recruitment. This lead to the prospect that the new AR app would need to support a wide user base
            who
            possesed varying levels
            of AR expertise. In addition, both the tech show and outreach environments required high vistor throughput,
            which didn't leave time for even basic
            vistor training on app use. To navigate this client base, the application would need to be simple for the
            end-user to navigate, and highly-controllably by the client
            in order to guaruntee a controlled, positive experience.
          </li>
          <li><strong>The client app should be a setup-free application that has minimal environment
              requirements:</strong>The primary point for this insight was that the client had virtually no in-house
            expertise in maintaining
            Hololens applications. Fast Effect had previously handled all aspects of deployment and maintenance during
            the
            initial AR app deployment,
            ,but the client had then used the app on its own, encountering multiple technical challenges, such poor
            lighting
            conditions, limited wireless access, and disrupted spatial tracking. Any solution we developed
            would need to ensure that the client could negotiate these challenges with minimal expertise.</li>
          <li><strong>The client has a variety of use cases for AR/VR tech as a whole, with some use cases more
              developed
              than
              others:</strong>This insights relates to the various views within the client organization regarding AR
            technology. The marketings and outreach
            departments were already onboard with the use of AR technology as a method of promoting the client
            organization
            as a technology company first, and a manufacturing
            one second. However, many of the technical subject matter experts within the company, whose expertise would
            eventually be provide product specifications, had significant
            reservations about the use of AR. Fast Effect needed to be aware of these internal pressures as it built the
            application.</li>
          <li><strong>The client app should be composed of parts that can be put together to tell an overall
              story:</strong>Throughout the entire
            stakeholder interview, the concept of a narrative was a central thread. This need manefisted itself in
            several
            ways. The client wanted to portray itself as forward-thinking, and wanted to use
            AR technology to "wow and dazzle" those who didn't know much about the client. The selection of the Hololens
            as
            a platform was built on this basis, as it boasted a futuristic-looking design, was not tethered, and was not
            isolating. However, the client did want the capability to create multiple narratives. During the interview,
            we
            provided the intial suggestion of "building" a presentation
            out of "parts", similar to how a car is constructed. The client took an immediate liking to this idea, even
            suggest a particular upcoming car
            technology system that could be used to prototype the modular approach.</li>
        </ol>

        <br>
        Based on these insights, I developed four further recommendations to additional guide further design and
        development:
        <br>
        <br>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Use only proven AR tracking technologies and avoid approaches that require the use of room-wide
              spacial
              mapping:</strong> The stakeholders revealed that we could not count on our client having access to a
            pre-defined, well-lit, stable venue environment to run a Hololens solution in. Based on this, we knew not to
            rely on
            room-wide spatial scans to trigger AR content. Instead, we knew to use Image and Model Targets as our
            primary
            triggers, or possibly some local, temporary location spatial anchors at certain specified locations.</li>
          <li><strong>Avoid targeting specific show venue designs, and instead develop generic solutions that work in
              either
              desktop or wall-mounted modes:</strong> This was another recommendation based on the lack of defined,
            stable
            venues for the client app to run in. I recommended following up with the client to determine a minimum
            amount of
            desk and wall-mounted space to support an app environment, and then build packaged versions of the app to
            target
            those sizes.</li>
          <li><strong>Further with the client to come up with a distinct target audience and a coherent
              message:</strong>As
            revealed by Insight #3, our client did not have an overall vision for its use of AR/VR tech, even within the
            public awareness sphere. One of the primary risks for the project is trying to satisfy so many potential
            stakeholders at the client organization that we wouldn't satisfy any of them to an acceptable degree. I
            recommended that we work further with the client to define a tight message and limited target user scope for
            the
            initial application.</li>
          <li><strong>Build a modular storytelling approach into the upcoming app.</strong> While we could, and should
            limit
            the scope of the message and target audience for the application this summer, that does not mean we couldn't
            think ahead to some degree for future messaging and purpose. I recommended building a generic data structure
            backend that allows us to associate individual modules with a larger story. This data structure could then
            be
            adapted to serve other client needs at a rapid pace.</li>
        </ol>



      </p>
      <h2>Ideation and Interaction Design</h2>
      <h3>Persona Development</h3>
      <p>Now that we had our initial set of application criteria completed, it was time to start ideating to determine
        the
        form that the application should take.
        I began by developing personas based on our two known client users: trade show presenters and outreach
        presenters. I
        developed
        a persona for each user type. These personas were then used to ground all future brainstorming session. Paper
        copies
        were also kept near the technical
        team's working space to remind it of who our users were, and what their needs really were.</p>

          </figure>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>Brainstorming</h3>

      <p>After persona development, I once again gathered the technical team and facilitated a brainstormed session. The
        first phase
        of the session was completely free-form, with the intent to generate as many ideas as possible, without
        immediate
        worry of feasibility (a fact that I
        had to repeatedly remind the participants of, as the session progressed). Once we had hashed out an initial set
        of
        ideas, we discussed them more in-depth. We had several front-runner ideas emerging,
        including an AR scavenger hunt, a virtual visitation with a 3-D model of a client engineer, an "innovation
        timeline"
        (involving a virtual car that would change based on the client's innovations over the years), and the guided
        presentation experience that
        ended up becoming AR Presenter. Out of these ideas, the guided experience seemed to be the front-runner, as it
        aligned most directly with the
        insights and recommendations developed during the stakeholder analysis. Fast Effect's principles concurred with
        our
        selection of the guided experience.</p>

      <h3>Interaction Design</h3>
      <p>
        Thanks to the brainstorming, we had a solid initial idea, but we didn't have enough specifics to go to the
        client. I
        therefore worked out the overall
        interaction design for the application. I built an initial set of interaction design sketches that outline the
        main
        interaction areas of the application:

        <h4>AR Presenter Features</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Adaptive Location Selection: </strong>In order to navigate a potentially confusing trade/tech show
            environment, the presenter has the option
            of placing a "marker" hologram to designate the physical location that best suits the presentation at hand.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Controlled Presenter Experience: </strong>While in presentation mode, the presenter has full
            control
            over the experience,
            with the ability to switch between pieces of AR content, and the ability to trigger specific interactions on
            them, which are then reflected in the presentee view in real-time.</li>
          <li><strong>Voice Chat </strong>Trade and Tech Show environments can be quite loud.  AR Presenter implements voice chat through the 
          Hololens microphone and speaker system to compenesate for the noise.</li>
          <li><strong>Standalone Mode: </strong>In situations where a presenter isn't available, presentations can be
            run
            in
            a "standalone" mode, with presentees able to use
            simplified versions of the presenter controls to walk through the experience.</li>
          <li><strong>"Parts" Ecosystem: </strong>The presentation system is modular. The AR Presenteer app has a
            dedicated
            mode for building presentations, utilizing a library
            of AR content that can be expanded as needed.</li>
          <li><strong>"Safe" Shared Experience Environment: </strong>Many trade show and other outreach environments has
            factors that interfere
            with the shared experiences as originally envisoned by Microsoft. Room scanning is disrupted by abrupt
            changes
            in venue space, poor lighting,
            or simply high traffic flow (which can trick the Hololens into that the layout of the room has changed). AR
            Presenter utilizes a sharing experience revolving
            around a local wireless router packaged with the system, married to a single shared anchor placed when the
            presentation is started. This ensures a usable
            shared experience even in crowded venue spaces.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      </p>

      <h3>Client Pitch and Feedback</h3>
      <p>After the initial interaction design had been worked out, it was time to present the AR Presenter concept to
        the
        client.
        I prepared a pitch presentation deck, which included the main insights we had learned from the Stakeholder
        Analysis, mockups of the primary views in the
        application, and both a short-term plan (to develop an initial prototype), and a long-term plan (to develop
        secondary features an an ecoysystem of AR content).
        <br>
        The client was overall pleased with the AR Presenter concept, and authorized the creation of an initial
        prototype.
        The client also provided additional Feedback
        on the concept, which was incorporated into the planning for the initial prototype.
      </p>


      <h2>Development and Demo - Putting It All Together</h2>

      <h3>Prototyping Development Planning</h3>
      <p>My next task was to plan the development cycle for the intial AR prototype. We had committed to having the
        prototype in two weeks. With help
        from my company mentor, I developed plans for two one-week sprints. These sprints were broken down by functional
        area, with Graphic Design, Application Development, and 3-D Artist
        each receiving tasks. My role within the sprints was two-fold. I acted as overall project/design lead, with
        final
        say over any design decisions that needed to be made during the sprints.
        I also acted as a secondary application developer, assisting the primary developer on the creation of the core
        application functinality.

        Once I had developed a plan, I held a kick-off meeting with the technical team to present the client feedback
        and
        sprint plan. Having this formal meeting ensured that
        all members of the technical team were on the same page, and gave them a venue to check the feasibility of the
        sprint plan and ask for any additional resources they needed.
        Providing this venue was a good move, as the primary developer requested from me a further breakdown of the
        application design, with more granualar steps than the initial set of design sketches.
        I provided this breakdown as my initial task during the sprint.</p>

      <h3>Development Sprints</h3>

      <p>During the AR prototype development sprints, I contributed to the development code in the following areas:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>I developed the high-level logic for the custom network messages functionality that would allow the presenter 
          Hololens to send messages to the presentee Hololens.  These messages were required to ensure that the presentees would see
          presenter changes in real-time.
        </li>
        <li>I implemented voice chat functionality, based on code examples from the Microsoft Hololens team.  This functionality
          would allow presenters to deal with loud trade show environments by being able to send their voice directly to the presentee Hololens.
        </li>
        <li>I assisted the primary programmer on the implementation of the Sharing service.  This service, again based on Microsoft code, would allow the 
          presenter to place and run their presentation at a specified location in the physical environment.  The primary challenge here was actually stripping
          functionality out of the Sharing service. The service normally scans a physical environment repeatedly in order to maintain and update
          its understanding, but our stakeholder analysis had revealed that this repeated scanning caused problems in a highly-trafficed environment.  We wanted 
          the Sharing service to scan the room only once (at the beginning of the session) and to forgot all physical environment data between presentations.
        </li>
      </ul>

          </figure>
        </div>
      </div>


      <h3> Client Demo</h3>
      <p>At the end of the second week of sprints, we invited our two client stakeholders in to test our demo.  We walked the client through our demo scenario and collected additional feedback.
        We did have to babysit the sharing function a bit by clearing out the room data one last time, but our client was able to walk through the saved presentation, trigger an interaction on a 
      car model, and hear each other through the voice chat functionality.  </p>


      <h2>Final Steps</h2>
      <p>Based on the success of the demo, our client authorized the creation of a full Version 1 of AR Presenter.  With that, I had achieved the overall
        goal of my appointment at Fast Effect.  I left my employers with a project plan for managing the deployment of the rest of the feature set initially
      envisioned for AR Presenter.     </p>
