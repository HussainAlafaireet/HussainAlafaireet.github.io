    <h2>Project Outcome</h2>


    <h3>AR Presenter</h3>

    <p>
      This project produced "AR Presenter": a Hololens-based augmented reality application designed to facilitate the
      trade/tech show experience. At the highest level, the product mimics the paradigm of Powerpoint, in that it allows
      presenters to build a "presentation" out of individual components, which can then be presented to
      viewers in a controlled manner. However, in this product, the "slides" are AR objects with triggerable
      interactions, and the "presentation" is a curated list AR objects that the presenter can switch between at will.
    </p>

    <h2>Problem To Be Solved</h2>
    <p>I worked on behalf of Fast Effect with one of their pre-existing clients, a car technology manufacturer in the
      Detroit, MI area. The client's problem was that it had purchased multiple Hololens units for use to demonstrate
      their
      products, primarily in a trade and tech show environment. In a forward-thinking effort, the client had purchased
      a
      number of Hololens units, and had previously asked Fast Effect
      to develop a directed tech show experience. This experience was ultimately judged to be a failure, and the
      Hololens units had been underutilized ever since.
      <br>
      <br>
      My task was to determine the reasons for the failure, understand where the client wanted to next head with
      Augmented Reality, and design a solution for that new direction.
    </p>



    <h2>My Contribution</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Stakeholder Analysis</h3>
    <p>
      I had a surprising (and enticing) level of freedom on this project, as the nature and scope of the project had
      not been defined when I joined Fast Effect. To provide this clarity, I first held stakeholder interviews with
      the
      client. I
      interviewed two primary stakeholders: the client's head of R&D marketing, and the head of community outreach.
      These interviews were held
      in a "contextual inquiry" manner, without a strict adherance to the interview protocol. This allows me to
      explore
      a wide range of topics related
      to the client's use and vision for augmented reality. With permission from the client, the interview's audio was
      recorded.
      <br>
      <br>
      Once the interviews were complete, I introduced Fast Effects to the concepts of <strong>interpretation
        sessions</strong>
      and <strong>affinity walls</strong>. Previously at the company, the interview results would be informally
      reviewed
      by the company principles,
      and passed on to the technical team over time. However, for this project, I gathered the technical team to
      review
      the stakeholder interview directly. This proved to
      be a fruitful decision, as the combination of expertise allowed us to pull far more insight from the interview
      notes than we would have otherwise. We assembled these insights
      into a series of affinity notes.
      <br>
      <br>
      Once the notes were completed, I lead the technical team in the creation of an affinity wall. From this affinity
      wall, we
      derived <strong>4 design principles</strong> that guided the entire project from that point:
      <ol>
        <li><strong>A controlled, easy-to-use experience was paramount for the client AR app:</strong>
          The interviews revealed the previous AR app, while designed for trade/tech shows, had been repurposed as an
          outreach solution for
          student recruitment. This lead to the prospect that the new AR app would need to support a wide user base
          who
          possesed varying levels
          of AR expertise. In addition, both the tech show and outreach environments required high vistor throughput,
          which didn't leave time for even basic
          vistor training on app use. To navigate this client base, the application would need to be simple for the
          end-user to navigate, and highly-controllably by the client
          in order to guaruntee a controlled, positive experience.
        </li>
        <li><strong>The client app should be a setup-free application that has minimal environment
            requirements:</strong>The primary point for this insight was that the client had virtually no in-house
          expertise in maintaining
          Hololens applications. Fast Effect had previously handled all aspects of deployment and maintenance during
          the
          initial AR app deployment,
          ,but the client had then used the app on its own, encountering multiple technical challenges, such poor
          lighting
          conditions, limited wireless access, and disrupted spatial tracking. Any solution we developed
          would need to ensure that the client could negotiate these challenges with minimal expertise.</li>
        <li><strong>The client has a variety of use cases for AR/VR tech as a whole, with some use cases more
            developed
            than
            others:</strong>This insights relates to the various views within the client organization regarding AR
          technology. The marketings and outreach
          departments were already onboard with the use of AR technology as a method of promoting the client
          organization
          as a technology company first, and a manufacturing
          one second. However, many of the technical subject matter experts within the company, whose expertise would
          eventually be provide product specifications, had significant
          reservations about the use of AR. Fast Effect needed to be aware of these internal pressures as it built the
          application.</li>
        <li><strong>The client app should be composed of parts that can be put together to tell an overall
            story:</strong>Throughout the entire
          stakeholder interview, the concept of a narrative was a central thread. This need manefisted itself in
          several
          ways. The client wanted to portray itself as forward-thinking, and wanted to use
          AR technology to "wow and dazzle" those who didn't know much about the client. The selection of the Hololens
          as
          a platform was built on this basis, as it boasted a futuristic-looking design, was not tethered, and was not
          isolating. However, the client did want the capability to create multiple narratives. During the interview,
          we
          provided the intial suggestion of "building" a presentation
          out of "parts", similar to how a car is constructed. The client took an immediate liking to this idea, even
          suggest a particular upcoming car
          technology system that could be used to prototype the modular approach.</li>
      </ol>

      <br>
      Based on these insights, I developed four further recommendations to additional guide further design and
      development:
      <br>
      <br>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Use only proven AR tracking technologies and avoid approaches that require the use of room-wide
            spacial
            mapping:</strong> The stakeholders revealed that we could not count on our client having access to a
          pre-defined, well-lit, stable venue environment to run a Hololens solution in. Based on this, we knew not to
          rely on
          room-wide spatial scans to trigger AR content. Instead, we knew to use Image and Model Targets as our
          primary
          triggers, or possibly some local, temporary location spatial anchors at certain specified locations.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid targeting specific show venue designs, and instead develop generic solutions that work in
            either
            desktop or wall-mounted modes:</strong> This was another recommendation based on the lack of defined,
          stable
          venues for the client app to run in. I recommended following up with the client to determine a minimum
          amount of
          desk and wall-mounted space to support an app environment, and then build packaged versions of the app to
          target
          those sizes.</li>
        <li><strong>Further with the client to come up with a distinct target audience and a coherent
            message:</strong>As
          revealed by Insight #3, our client did not have an overall vision for its use of AR/VR tech, even within the
          public awareness sphere. One of the primary risks for the project is trying to satisfy so many potential
          stakeholders at the client organization that we wouldn't satisfy any of them to an acceptable degree. I
          recommended that we work further with the client to define a tight message and limited target user scope for
          the
          initial application.</li>
        <li><strong>Build a modular storytelling approach into the upcoming app.</strong> While we could, and should
          limit
          the scope of the message and target audience for the application this summer, that does not mean we couldn't
          think ahead to some degree for future messaging and purpose. I recommended building a generic data structure
          backend that allows us to associate individual modules with a larger story. This data structure could then
          be
          adapted to serve other client needs at a rapid pace.</li>
      </ol>



    </p>
    <h3>Ideation and Interaction Design</h3>
    <h4>Persona Development</h4>
    <p>Now that we had our initial set of application criteria completed, it was time to start ideating to determine
      the
      form that the application should take.
      I began by developing personas based on our two known client users: trade show presenters and outreach
      presenters. I
      developed
      a persona for each user type. These personas were then used to ground all future brainstorming session. Paper
      copies
      were also kept near the technical
      team's working space to remind it of who our users were, and what their needs really were.</p>

        needs.</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>
  <div class="col-2"></div>
</div>

    <h4>Brainstorming</h4>

    <p>After persona development, I once again gathered the technical team and facilitated a brainstormed session. The
      first phase
      of the session was completely free-form, with the intent to generate as many ideas as possible, without
      immediate
      worry of feasibility (a fact that I
      had to repeatedly remind the participants of, as the session progressed). Once we had hashed out an initial set
      of
      ideas, we discussed them more in-depth. We had several front-runner ideas emerging,
      including an AR scavenger hunt, a virtual visitation with a 3-D model of a client engineer, an "innovation
      timeline"
      (involving a virtual car that would change based on the client's innovations over the years), and the guided
      presentation experience that
      ended up becoming AR Presenter. Out of these ideas, the guided experience seemed to be the front-runner, as it
      aligned most directly with the
      insights and recommendations developed during the stakeholder analysis. Fast Effect's principles concurred with
      our
      selection of the guided experience.</p>
    <br>


    <h4>Interaction Design</h4>
    <p>
      Thanks to the brainstorming, we had a solid initial idea, but we didn't have enough specifics to go to the
      client. I
      therefore worked out the overall
      interaction design for the application. I built an initial set of interaction design sketches that outline the
      main
      interaction areas of the application:
      <ol>
        <li>Place Hologram View</li>
        <li>Main Menu View</li>
        <li>Presentation Dialogue View</li>
        <li>Presentation Play View</li>
        <li>Presentation Parts Content Play View</li>
        <li>Curved Button UI Element</li>
        <li>AR Parts View</li>
        <li>Anticipated System Architecture</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
