          <strong>Summary: </strong> Mandala Ball is a VR medical therapy game for the Oculus Quest. The game trains
          children with ADHD to manage their ADHD symptoms. Mandala Ball is built around the idea of the “Mind has
          Power”. Mandala Ball simulates “mind
          powers” though handtracking input. By tying the use of these “powers” to control of ADHD, we motivate our
          players to actively manage their ADHD condition.

          This project was an entry to the <a href="https://devpost.com/software/mandala-ball">Virtual Medicine
            Conference
            2020 Online Hackathon</a>.

          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>My Contributions: </strong>
          <br>
          <br>


          <strong>As Team Lead</strong>, I managed a remote team of video producers, medical researchers, and 3-D
          artists towards a
          single vision of VR therapy.
          I acted as the team lead, primary UX designer, and primary developer for Mandala Ball.
          <br>
          <br>

          <strong>As UX Designer</strong>, I generated the primary design concept for Mandala Ball, including the
          Mandala Ball social
          companion, the key stakeholders, the primary features, and the technical architecture.

          <br>
          <br>

          As <strong>VR Developer</strong>, I coded the Mandala Ball VR app, using a combination of Unity, Microsoft
          Mixed Reality
          Toolkit, and custom game code.

    </div>





    <div class="container m1">
      <h2 class="text-center sumh2title">Explore</h2>
      <h3>Brainstorming</h3>
      <p class="sumtext">
        I worked with <a href="https://devpost.com/vicely07">Vi Li</a>, <a href="https://devpost.com/joseroserois">Jose
          Rosero</a>, and <a href="https://devpost.com/eric100">Eric Tao</a> on this project. As a Hackathon team, our
        first task was to determine a scope and a core idea that we could build a VR app
        around. Our initial meeting
        establish two scoping parameters:
      </p>
      <ul class="sumtext">
        <li><strong>Hand Tracking: </strong>We were interested in using hand tracking technology
          to replace controllers in VR apps.</li>
        <li><strong>Pediatric Care: </strong>As a team, we were most interested in supporting pediatric patients, as we
          felt an emotional connection towards helping them.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="sumtext">
        Once we had our initial areas of interest, we spent the next week brainstorming ideas.

        The core idea we rallied around was a VR neurofeedback training game to control ADHD. In ADHD neurofeedback
        training, users attempt to maintain concentration and focus, and receive
        real-time feedback in the form of EEG brain measurements. By engaging in this feedback loop, users learn to
        control their brain, and their ADHD symptoms.
        <br>
        <br>

        Our game would add VR handtracking elements
        to simulate telekinetic superpowers. In this way, we would create an interactive, motivating ADHD training game
        that our target audience would be delighted to play.

      </p>

    </div>

    <div class="container m1">
      <h2 class="text-center sumh2title">Investigate</h2>

      <h3>Secondary Research</h3>
      <p class="sumtext">To flesh out our core idea, we conducted secondary research on pediatric ADHD, neurofeedback
        training,
        and the use of VR to treat ADHD. This research included an academic paper review, a comparative analysis of
        existing neurofeedback training products, and an interview with an elementary school teacher with ADHD
        training.

        <br>
        <br>
        Our research review led to the following insights:


        <ol class="sumtext">
          <li>Our design needed to include school-related settings, but with an approach that did not trigger existing
            social stigma concerns our players might have.
          </li>
          <li>Some level of social interaction would be needed to guide, praise, and encourage our players.</li>
          <li>Listening, reading, and taking turn activities would be particularly difficult tasks for our players.</li>
          <li>Most tasks should be small, with plenty of room for breaks and task switching.</li>
          <li>Therapists and doctors would need a way to monitor training progression over time.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>


      <h3>Initial Prototype</h3>

      <p class="sumtext">
        To establish a base development pipeline, I used the <a
          href="https://github.com/provencher/MRTK-Quest">MRTK-Quest handtracking kit</a> and Unity to create a
        prototype of our game. This version included:
        <ul class="sumtext">
          <li>A "concentration sphere" that would be the visual indicator for EEG data. While no EEG data was involved
            in
            this build, I provided a vision of the indicator we might use through the use of a color change and a sound
            to
            indicate good concentration.</li>
          <li>An example "telekinesis" activity involving the placement of a coffee cup in a box.</li>
          <li>A basic living room environment (sourced from Google Poly) with a distracting kitchen background sound.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h2 class="text-center sumh2title">Design</h2>

      <p class="sumtext"> It was now time to expand out the core idea into
        a true vision of the game.
        I synthesized our brainstorming and secondary research to develop "Mandala Ball" - an VR app that uses the idea
        of
        "The Mind Has Power" to create <strong>an empowering tool for children with ADHD.</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        The Mandala Ball design concept has the following <strong>5 main features</strong>:

        <div class="container m1">
          <h3>Mandala Ball Companion</h3>

          <p class="sumtext">
            The Mandala Ball is the central design feature of our app. Inspired by the <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandala">mandala meditation
              diagrams from Eastern religion</a>
            , the Mandala Ball is an ever-present companion. Mandala Ball interact with the player in two ways:
            <ul class="sumtext">
              <li>talking to the player, providing instructions and encouragement.</li>
              <li>glowing to indicate player concentration. The better the player concentrates, the more intense the
                glow.
              </li>
            </ul>

          <p class="sumtext">
            Mandala Ball activities come in two types: Concentration and Telekinesis
          </p>
          <p class="sumtext">Concentration activities are neurofeedback exercises managed by the Mandala Ball. As the
            player
            concentrates,
            EEG output is fed to the Mandala Ball. The Ball then begins glowing and providing encouragement to promote
            further
            concentration.</p>

    <div class="container m1">
      <h3>Scaling Environments</h3>
      <p class="sumtext">
        Mandala Ball comes with 3 virtual environments: a living room, a school hallway, and a school classroom. These
        environments were selected for their relevance to
        everyday ADHD challenges our target audience would face.
      </p>



      <p class="sumtext">
        In addition to the session settings, each environment has it's own set of audio/visual distractions that can be
        added for additional challenge.
      </p>

    </div>


    <div class="container m1">

      <h3>Simulation Control User Interface</h3>
      <p class="sumtext">Parents, therapist, and doctors can monitor
        and control Mandala Ball sessions via a real-time video feed and pre-session setup controls.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="container m1">

      <h3>Data Analytics Dashboard</h3>
      <p class="sumtext">Mandala Ball comes with a Data Analytics Dashboard that
        allows all stakeholders to see progression of VR therapy. Each stakeholder receives a visualization that
        matches their specific needs.</p>

    <div class="container m1">
      <h2 class="text-center sumh2title">Develop</h2>

      <p class="sumtext">
        Due to time constraints, our Hackathon demo would not include all features from the Mandala Ball design concept.
        For our demo, we implemented:
        <ul class="sumtext">
          <li>"Telekinesis" Hand Tracking</li>
          <li>A prototype Version of the Mandala Ball Companion, using visual design, Unity animations, and voice
            acting.</li>
          <li>A prototype training session, including both a Concentration and Telekinesis activity. While direct EEG
            integration was not part of this demo,
            the visual indicators used to give feedback were present in the Mandala Ball companion.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p class="sumtext">During a 1.5 week sprint, I coded the game in Unity. I used Simon Says as the inspiration for
        our Telekinesis activity, integrating the visual assets produced
        by the team's technical artist.</p>

            to implement due to the remote nature of the team.  For <strong>future remote work, I will leverage 360 sketching and basic object placement in AFrame
            to create a remote meeting space for VR design work</strong>.

            There was a <strong>disparity between team members in knowledge of VR technology basics</strong>.  This limited the ability of some members to easily contribute
            to the product during the development stage.  For future hackathon work, I will build a "VR Basics" Powerpoint that will help equalize the VR knowledge of the team.
