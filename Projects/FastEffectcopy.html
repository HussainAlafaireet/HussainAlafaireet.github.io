    <div class=project-intro-box>
      <p><strong>Role: </strong> Product Designer &nbsp;|&nbsp; <strong>Duration: </strong>8 Weeks
        <br>
        <strong>Tools Used: </strong>Unity (initial prototyping, networking), Hololens Toolkit (connecting Hololens to
        Unity), Microsoft Sharing Services (used to establish app spatial tracking)
        <br>
        <strong>UX Skills Used: </strong>User/Stakeholder Interivews, Personas, Storyboarding, Prototyping ,
        Stakeholder Pitching
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Summary: </strong>AR Presenter, developed by Fast Effect in Summer 2018, is a Hololens-based Augmented
        Reality software used to
        demonstrate products in trade/tech show
        venues. AR Presenter uses a careful combination of local-area location sharing, simplified presenter control,
        and
        modular AR presentation construction to defeat the the problems typical AR products face when used in the show
        environment.

        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>My Contributions: </strong> As the AR Product Design Lead, <strong>I acted as the guiding light
        </strong> behind the AR Presenter
        prototype. I
        conducted stakeholder research to determine the real user needs, generated the interaction design for
        AR Presenter, and oversaw it's development cycle. Along the way, I introduced Fast Effect to the
        Interpretation
        Session and Affinity Wall user-centered design technique, as well as <strong>fostering an enhanced degree of
          ownership
          and
          teamwork within an interdisciplinary development team. </strong>

      <blockquote>The typical AR app performs badly in the trade show environment.</blockquote>
    </div>

    <br>

    <p>I worked on behalf of Fast Effect with one of their pre-existing clients, a car technology manufacturer in the
      Detroit, MI area. The client had multiple Hololens wireless AR headsets, and had previously tried to perform
      product demonstrations with them
      via an AR app. The client had not been satisfied with the overall expereince of this previous app, and the
      Hololens had been underutilized ever since.
      <br>
      <br>
      My task was to determine the reasons for the disatisfaction, understand where the client wanted to next head with
      Augmented Reality, and design a solution for that new direction.

      <br>
      <br>
      Here's the process I used to arrive at AR Presenter:

    <h2 class="text-center">Stakeholder Analysis - What do you REALLY want?</h2>
    <p>
      In order to understand the previous app history and it's corresponding effect on the stakeholder desires for a new
      app, I conducted a set of
      semi-structured stakeholder interviews. I interviewed the heads of the two client departments using the previous
      app: The head of R&D marketing, and the head of community outreach.
      With permission from the client, the interview's audio was recorded.
      <br>
      <br>
      Once the interviews were complete, I introduced Fast Effect to the concepts of <strong>interpretation
        sessions</strong>
      and <strong>affinity walls</strong>. During the interpretation session, I led a facilitated review of the audio
      recordings pulling on my UX experience and the team's institutional knowledge of the client to identify important
      points.
      We then conducted an affinity wall session to organize and categorize these key points, deriving <strong>4 key
        findings:</strong>

      1. A controlled, easy-to-use experience was paramount for the client AR app
      2. The client app should be a setup-free application that has minimal environment
      requirements.
      3. The client has a variety of use cases for AR/VR tech as a whole, with some use cases more
      developed
      than
      others
      4. >The client app should be composed of parts that can be put together to tell an overall
      story

      <br>
      <br>

      Once the notes were completed, I lead the technical team in the creation of an affinity wall. From this affinity
      wall, we
      derived <strong>4 design principles</strong> that guided the entire project from that point:
      <ol>
        <li><strong>A controlled, easy-to-use experience was paramount for the client AR app:</strong>
          The interviews revealed the previous AR app, while designed for trade/tech shows, had been repurposed as an
          outreach solution for
          student recruitment. This lead to the prospect that the new AR app would need to support a wide user base
          who
          possesed varying levels
          of AR expertise. In addition, both the tech show and outreach environments required high vistor throughput,
          which didn't leave time for even basic
          vistor training on app use. To navigate this client base, the application would need to be simple for the
          end-user to navigate, and highly-controllably by the client
          in order to guaruntee a controlled, positive experience.
        </li>
        <li><strong>The client app should be a setup-free application that has minimal environment
            requirements:</strong>The primary point for this insight was that the client had virtually no in-house
          expertise in maintaining
          Hololens applications. Fast Effect had previously handled all aspects of deployment and maintenance during
          the
          initial AR app deployment,
          ,but the client had then used the app on its own, encountering multiple technical challenges, such poor
          lighting
          conditions, limited wireless access, and disrupted spatial tracking. Any solution we developed
          would need to ensure that the client could negotiate these challenges with minimal expertise.</li>
        <li><strong>The client has a variety of use cases for AR/VR tech as a whole, with some use cases more
            developed
            than
            others:</strong>This insights relates to the various views within the client organization regarding AR
          technology. The marketings and outreach
          departments were already onboard with the use of AR technology as a method of promoting the client
          organization
          as a technology company first, and a manufacturing
          one second. However, many of the technical subject matter experts within the company, whose expertise would
          eventually be provide product specifications, had significant
          reservations about the use of AR. Fast Effect needed to be aware of these internal pressures as it built the
          application.</li>
        <li><strong>The client app should be composed of parts that can be put together to tell an overall
            story:</strong>Throughout the entire
          stakeholder interview, the concept of a narrative was a central thread. This need manefisted itself in
          several
          ways. The client wanted to portray itself as forward-thinking, and wanted to use
          AR technology to "wow and dazzle" those who didn't know much about the client. The selection of the Hololens
          as
          a platform was built on this basis, as it boasted a futuristic-looking design, was not tethered, and was not
          isolating. However, the client did want the capability to create multiple narratives. During the interview,
          we
          provided the intial suggestion of "building" a presentation
          out of "parts", similar to how a car is constructed. The client took an immediate liking to this idea, even
          suggest a particular upcoming car
          technology system that could be used to prototype the modular approach.</li>
      </ol>

      <br>
      Based on these insights, I developed four further recommendations to additional guide further design and
      development:
      <br>
      <br>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Use only proven AR tracking technologies and avoid approaches that require the use of room-wide
            spacial
            mapping:</strong> The stakeholders revealed that we could not count on our client having access to a
          pre-defined, well-lit, stable venue environment to run a Hololens solution in. Based on this, we knew not to
          rely on
          room-wide spatial scans to trigger AR content. Instead, we knew to use Image and Model Targets as our
          primary
          triggers, or possibly some local, temporary location spatial anchors at certain specified locations.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid targeting specific show venue designs, and instead develop generic solutions that work in
            either
            desktop or wall-mounted modes:</strong> This was another recommendation based on the lack of defined,
          stable
          venues for the client app to run in. I recommended following up with the client to determine a minimum
          amount of
          desk and wall-mounted space to support an app environment, and then build packaged versions of the app to
          target
          those sizes.</li>
        <li><strong>Further with the client to come up with a distinct target audience and a coherent
            message:</strong>As
          revealed by Insight #3, our client did not have an overall vision for its use of AR/VR tech, even within the
          public awareness sphere. One of the primary risks for the project is trying to satisfy so many potential
          stakeholders at the client organization that we wouldn't satisfy any of them to an acceptable degree. I
          recommended that we work further with the client to define a tight message and limited target user scope for
          the
          initial application.</li>
        <li><strong>Build a modular storytelling approach into the upcoming app.</strong> While we could, and should
          limit
          the scope of the message and target audience for the application this summer, that does not mean we couldn't
          think ahead to some degree for future messaging and purpose. I recommended building a generic data structure
          backend that allows us to associate individual modules with a larger story. This data structure could then
          be
          adapted to serve other client needs at a rapid pace.</li>
      </ol>



    </p>
    <h2>Ideation and Interaction Design</h2>
    <h3>Persona Development</h3>
    <p>Now that we had our initial set of application criteria completed, it was time to start ideating to determine
      the
      form that the application should take.
      I began by developing personas based on our two known client users: trade show presenters and outreach
      presenters. I
      developed
      a persona for each user type. These personas were then used to ground all future brainstorming session. Paper
      copies
      were also kept near the technical
      team's working space to remind it of who our users were, and what their needs really were.</p>

            needs.</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Brainstorming</h3>

    <p>After persona development, I once again gathered the technical team and facilitated a brainstormed session. The
      first phase
      of the session was completely free-form, with the intent to generate as many ideas as possible, without
      immediate
      worry of feasibility (a fact that I
      had to repeatedly remind the participants of, as the session progressed). Once we had hashed out an initial set
      of
      ideas, we discussed them more in-depth. We had several front-runner ideas emerging,
      including an AR scavenger hunt, a virtual visitation with a 3-D model of a client engineer, an "innovation
      timeline"
      (involving a virtual car that would change based on the client's innovations over the years), and the guided
      presentation experience that
      ended up becoming AR Presenter. Out of these ideas, the guided experience seemed to be the front-runner, as it
      aligned most directly with the
      insights and recommendations developed during the stakeholder analysis. Fast Effect's principles concurred with
      our
      selection of the guided experience.</p>

    <h3>Interaction Design</h3>
    <p>
      Thanks to the brainstorming, we had a solid initial idea, but we didn't have enough specifics to go to the
      client. I
      therefore worked out the overall
      interaction design for the application. I built an initial set of interaction design sketches that outline the
      main
      interaction areas of the application:</p>

    <h4>AR Presenter Features</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Adaptive Location Selection: </strong>In order to navigate a potentially confusing trade/tech show
        environment, the presenter has the option
        of placing a "marker" hologram to designate the physical location that best suits the presentation at hand.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Controlled Presenter Experience: </strong>While in presentation mode, the presenter has full
        control
        over the experience,
        with the ability to switch between pieces of AR content, and the ability to trigger specific interactions on
        them, which are then reflected in the presentee view in real-time.</li>
      <li><strong>Voice Chat </strong>Trade and Tech Show environments can be quite loud. AR Presenter implements
        voice chat through the
        Hololens microphone and speaker system to compenesate for the noise.</li>
      <li><strong>Standalone Mode: </strong>In situations where a presenter isn't available, presentations can be
        run
        in
        a "standalone" mode, with presentees able to use
        simplified versions of the presenter controls to walk through the experience.</li>
      <li><strong>"Parts" Ecosystem: </strong>The presentation system is modular. The AR Presenteer app has a
        dedicated
        mode for building presentations, utilizing a library
        of AR content that can be expanded as needed.</li>
      <li><strong>"Safe" Shared Experience Environment: </strong>Many trade show and other outreach environments has
        factors that interfere
        with the shared experiences as originally envisoned by Microsoft. Room scanning is disrupted by abrupt
        changes
        in venue space, poor lighting,
        or simply high traffic flow (which can trick the Hololens into that the layout of the room has changed). AR
        Presenter utilizes a sharing experience revolving
        around a local wireless router packaged with the system, married to a single shared anchor placed when the
        presentation is started. This ensures a usable
        shared experience even in crowded venue spaces.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    </p>

    <h3>Client Pitch and Feedback</h3>
    <p>After the initial interaction design had been worked out, it was time to present the AR Presenter concept to
      the
      client.
      I prepared a pitch presentation deck, which included the main insights we had learned from the Stakeholder
      Analysis, mockups of the primary views in the
      application, and both a short-term plan (to develop an initial prototype), and a long-term plan (to develop
      secondary features an an ecoysystem of AR content).
      <br><br>
      The client was overall pleased with the AR Presenter concept, and authorized the creation of an initial
      prototype.
      The client also provided additional Feedback
      on the concept, which was incorporated into the planning for the initial prototype.
    </p>


    <h2>Development and Demo - Putting It All Together</h2>

    <h3>Prototyping Development Planning</h3>
    <p>My next task was to plan the development cycle for the intial AR prototype. We had committed to having the
      prototype in two weeks. With help
      from my company mentor, I developed plans for two one-week sprints. These sprints were broken down by functional
      area, with Graphic Design, Application Development, and 3-D Artist
      each receiving tasks. My role within the sprints was two-fold. I acted as overall project/design lead, with
      final
      say over any design decisions that needed to be made during the sprints.
      I also acted as a secondary application developer, assisting the primary developer on the creation of the core
      application functinality.

      Once I had developed a plan, I held a kick-off meeting with the technical team to present the client feedback
      and
      sprint plan. Having this formal meeting ensured that
      all members of the technical team were on the same page, and gave them a venue to check the feasibility of the
      sprint plan and ask for any additional resources they needed.
      Providing this venue was a good move, as the primary developer requested from me a further breakdown of the
      application design, with more granualar steps than the initial set of design sketches.
      I provided this breakdown as my initial task during the sprint.</p>

    <h3>Development Sprints</h3>

    <p>During the AR prototype development sprints, I contributed to the development code in the following areas:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>I developed the high-level logic for the custom network messages functionality that would allow the
        presenter
        Hololens to send messages to the presentee Hololens. These messages were required to ensure that the
        presentees would see
        presenter changes in real-time.
      </li>
      <li>I implemented voice chat functionality, based on code examples from the Microsoft Hololens team. This
        functionality
        would allow presenters to deal with loud trade show environments by being able to send their voice directly to
        the presentee Hololens.
      </li>
      <li>I assisted the primary programmer on the implementation of the Sharing service. This service, again based on
        Microsoft code, would allow the
        presenter to place and run their presentation at a specified location in the physical environment. The primary
        challenge here was actually stripping
        functionality out of the Sharing service. The service normally scans a physical environment repeatedly in
        order to maintain and update
        its understanding, but our stakeholder analysis had revealed that this repeated scanning caused problems in a
        highly-trafficed environment. We wanted
        the Sharing service to scan the room only once (at the beginning of the session) and to forgot all physical
        environment data between presentations.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Client Demo</h3>
    <p>At the end of the second week of sprints, we invited our two client stakeholders in to test our demo. We walked
      the client through our demo scenario and collected additional feedback.
      We did have to babysit the sharing function a bit by clearing out the room data one last time, but our client
      was able to walk through the saved presentation, trigger an interaction on a
      car model, and hear each other through the voice chat functionality. </p>


    <h2>Final Steps</h2>
    <p>Based on the success of the demo, our client authorized the creation of a full Version 1 of AR Presenter. With
      that, I had achieved the overall
      goal of my appointment at Fast Effect. I left my employers with a project plan for managing the deployment of
      the rest of the feature set initially
      envisioned for AR Presenter. </p>
