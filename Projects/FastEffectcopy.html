    <div class=project-intro-box>
      <p><strong>Role: </strong> Product Designer &nbsp;|&nbsp; <strong>Duration: </strong>8 Weeks
        <br>
        <strong>Tools Used: </strong>Unity (initial prototyping, networking), Hololens Toolkit (connecting Hololens to
        Unity), Microsoft Sharing Services (used to establish app spatial tracking)
        <br>
        <strong>UX Skills Used: </strong>User/Stakeholder Interviews, Personas, Storyboarding, Prototyping ,
        Stakeholder Pitching
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Summary: </strong>AR Presenter, developed by Fast Effect in Summer 2018, is a Hololens-based Augmented
        Reality software used to
        demonstrate products in trade/tech show
        venues. AR Presenter uses a careful combination of local-area location sharing, simplified presenter control,
        and
        modular AR presentation construction to defeat the the problems typical AR products face when used in the show
        environment.

        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>My Contributions: </strong> As the AR Product Design Lead, <strong>I was the guiding light
        </strong> behind the AR Presenter
        prototype. I
        conducted stakeholder research to determine the real user needs, generated the interaction design for
        AR Presenter, and oversaw it's development cycle. Along the way, I introduced Fast Effect to the
        Interpretation
        Session and Affinity Wall user-centered design technique, as well as <strong>fostering an enhanced degree of
          ownership
          and
          teamwork within an interdisciplinary development team. </strong>
      </p>

    <h2 class="text-center"><strong>Process</strong></h2>

    <div class="callout">
      <blockquote>The typical AR app performs badly in the trade show environment.</blockquote>
    </div>

    <p>I worked on behalf of Fast Effect with one of their pre-existing clients, a car technology manufacturer in the
      Detroit, MI area. The client had multiple Hololens wireless AR headsets, and had previously tried to perform
      product demonstrations with them
      via an AR app. The client had not been satisfied with the overall expereince of this previous app, and the
      Hololens had been underutilized ever since.
      <br>
      <br>
      My task was to determine the reasons for the disatisfaction, understand where the client wanted to next head with
      Augmented Reality, and design a solution for that new direction.

      <br>
      <br>
      Here's the process I used to arrive at AR Presenter:
    </p>

    <br>



    <h2>Explore</h2>
    <p>
      <h3>Stakeholder Interviews</h3>

      <div class="callout">
        <blockquote>The client needed an AR app that was visitor-friendly, easy to maintain, and venue-agnostic.
        </blockquote>
      </div>

      In order to understand the previous app history and it's corresponding effect on the stakeholder desires for a new
      app, I conducted a set of
      semi-structured stakeholder interviews. I interviewed the heads of the two client departments using the previous
      app: The head of R&D marketing, and the head of community outreach.
      With permission from the client, the interview's audio was recorded.
      <br>
      <br>


      <h3>Previous App Review</h3>
      <p>
        The Fast Effect development team had also observed the previous client team in action, and their overall observations
        overlapped significantly with the client observations.  In addition, the development team was able to provide technical explanations as to 
        why the issues observed had actually occured.  This would be of great help when I began the design process for AR Presenter, as I was able to avoid these technical
        challenges from the start.
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>

      

      <h2>Analysis</h2>
      <br>
      <h3>Affinity Wall</h3>

      Once the exploration activities were complete, I introduced Fast Effect to the concepts of <strong>interpretation
          sessions</strong>
        and <strong>affinity walls</strong>. During the interpretation session, I led a facilitated review of the audio
        recordings pulling on my UX experience and the team's institutional knowledge of the client to identify important
        points.
        We then conducted an affinity wall session to organize and categorize these key points, deriving <strong>4 key
          findings.</strong>

      <h3>Personas</h3>
      <p>Now that we had our initial set of application criteria completed, it was time to start ideating to determine
        the
        form that the application should take.
        I began by developing personas based on our two known client users: trade show presenters and outreach
        presenters. I
        developed
        a persona for each user type. These personas were then used to ground all future brainstorming session. Paper
        copies
        were also kept near the technical
        team's working space to remind it of who our users were, and what their needs really were.</p>

      </div>


     

      <h3>Team Brainstorming</h3>




      <p>After persona development, I once again gathered the technical team and facilitated a brainstormed session. The
        first phase
        of the session was completely free-form, with the intent to generate as many ideas as possible, without
        immediate
        worry of feasibility (a fact that I
        had to repeatedly remind the participants of, as the session progressed). Once we had hashed out an initial set
        of
        ideas, we discussed them more in-depth. We had several front-runner ideas emerging,
        including an AR scavenger hunt, a virtual visitation with a 3-D model of a client engineer, an "innovation
        timeline"
        (involving a virtual car that would change based on the client's innovations over the years), and the guided
        presentation experience that
        ended up becoming AR Presenter. Out of these ideas, the guided experience seemed to be the front-runner, as it
        aligned most directly with the
        insights and recommendations developed during the stakeholder analysis. Fast Effect's principles concurred with
        our
        selection of the guided experience.</p>

      <h3>Interaction Design</h3>
      <p>
        Thanks to the brainstorming, we had a solid initial idea, but we didn't have enough specifics to go to the
        client. I
        therefore worked out the overall
        interaction design for the application. I built an initial set of interaction design sketches that outline the
        main
        interaction areas of the application:</p>

      <h4>Proposed AR Presenter Features</h4>

            <img src="/assets/FE_Internship/Icons/hologram.png" alt="" class="mx-auto d-block img-fluid">
          <h5>Adaptive Location Selection</h5>
          <p>In order to navigate a potentially confusing trade/tech show
            environment, the presenter has the option
            of placing a "marker" hologram to designate the physical location that best suits the presentation at hand.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-4 text-center">
            <img src="/assets/FE_Internship/Icons/control.png" alt="" class="mx-auto d-block img-fluid">
          <h5>Controlled Presenter Experience</h5>
          <p>While in presentation mode, the presenter has full
            control
            over the experience,
            with the ability to switch between pieces of AR content, and the ability to trigger specific interactions on
            them, which are then reflected in the presentee view in real-time.</p>

        <div class="col-4 text-center">
            <img src="/assets/FE_Internship/Icons/headset.png" alt="" class="mx-auto d-block img-fluid">
          <h5>Voice Chat</h5>
          <p>Trade and Tech Show environments can be quite loud. AR Presenter implements
            voice chat through the
            Hololens microphone and speaker system to compensate for the noise.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

          <h5>Standalone Mode</h5>
          <p>In situations where a presenter isn't available, presentations can be
            run
            in
            a "standalone" mode, with presentees able to use
            simplified versions of the presenter controls to walk through the experience.</p>

            <img src="/assets/FE_Internship/Icons/interactivity.png" alt="" class="mx-auto d-block img-fluid">
          <h5>"Parts" Ecosystem</h5>
          <p>The presentation system is modular. The AR Presenteer app has a
            dedicated
            mode for building presentations, utilizing a library
            of AR content that can be expanded as needed.</p>

        <div class="col-4 text-center">
          <img src="/assets/FE_Internship/Icons/interaction.png" alt="" class="mx-auto d-block img-fluid">
          <h5>"Safe" Shared Experience Environment</h5>
          <p> AR Presenter utilizes a sharing experience revolving
            around a local wireless router packaged with the system, married to a single shared anchor placed when the
            presentation is started. This ensures a usable
            shared experience even in crowded venue spaces with poor lighting conditions.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <br>


      <h3>Lo-Fi Prototyping</h3>

      <p>To clarify the vision of AR Presenter to our client, I developed a series of lo-fi Photoshop shots for use in a
      client pitch presentation. These shots,
      while still preliminary, created a clear, compelling view of AR Presenter and it's primary features.</p>

      <h3>Client Pitch Presentation</h3>
      <p>After the initial interaction design had been worked out, it was time to present the AR Presenter concept to
        the
        client.
        I prepared a pitch presentation deck, which included the main insights we had learned from the Stakeholder
        Analysis, mockups of the primary views in the
        application, and both a short-term plan (to develop an initial prototype), and a long-term plan (to develop
        secondary features an an ecosystem of AR content).
        <br><br>
        The client was overall pleased with the AR Presenter concept, and authorized the creation of an initial
        prototype.
        The client also provided additional Feedback
        on the concept, which was incorporated into the planning for the initial prototype.
      </p>
      <br>


      <h2>Develop</h2>

      <div class="callout">
        <blockquote>We were able to develop a successful prototype in a minimal amount of time, thanks to the correct
          design and strong team cohesion.</blockquote>
      </div>







      <h3>Sprint Planning</h3>
      <p>My next task was to plan the development cycle for the intial AR prototype. We had committed to having the
        prototype in two weeks, which meant that implementing all of the proposed features of AR Presenter was not feasible.  I isolated
        a subset of features that, when implemented, would show off the capabilities of the design.  These features were:
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Adaptive Location Selection</strong>:  This feature would shoe that our prototype could handle the trade show environment.</li>
          <li><strong>Controlled Presenter Experience</strong>:  This feature is the core of the AR Presenter user experience, and was required to give the client a realistic idea of what the final app would be like.</li>
          <li><strong>Voice Chat</strong>:  Previous explorations of Hololens tech had shown that this feature would be relatively simple to implement.</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        I developed plans for two one-week sprints. These sprints were broken down by
        functional
        area, with Graphic Design, Application Development, and 3-D Artist
        each receiving tasks. My role within the sprints was two-fold. I acted as overall project/design lead, with
        final
        say over any design decisions that needed to be made during the sprints.
        I also acted as a secondary application developer, assisting the primary developer on the creation of the core
        application functionality.
        <br>
        <br>
        I also worked with the rest of the team to design our specific use case scenario for the demo.
        The demo would revolve around a particular new auto technology system that our client had recently developed.  The scenario would include two main 
        AR objects:  a detailed, close-up car to introduce the system, and a wide-shot road simulation to show how the technology would work in action.
        <br>
        <br>

        Once I had developed a plan, I held a kick-off meeting with the technical team to present the client feedback
        and
        sprint plan. Having this formal meeting ensured that
        all members of the technical team were on the same page, and gave them a venue to check the feasibility of the
        sprint plan and ask for any additional resources they needed.
        <br>
        <br>

        <h3>User Journey Design</h3>

        Providing this venue was a good move, as the primary developer requested from me a further breakdown of the
        application design, with more granualar steps than the initial set of design sketches.
        I provided this breakdown as my initial task during the sprint.</p>

      <h3>App Development</h3>

      <p>During the AR prototype development sprints, I contributed to the development code in the following areas:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>I developed the high-level logic for the custom network messages functionality that would allow the
          presenter
          Hololens to send messages to the presentee Hololens. These messages were required to ensure that the
          presentees would see
          presenter changes in real-time.
        </li>
        <li>I implemented voice chat functionality, based on code examples from the Microsoft Hololens team. This
          functionality
          would allow presenters to deal with loud trade show environments by being able to send their voice directly
          to
          the presentee Hololens.
        </li>
        <li>I assisted the primary programmer on the implementation of the Sharing service. This service, again based
          on
          Microsoft code, would allow the
          presenter to place and run their presentation at a specified location in the physical environment. The
          primary
          challenge here was actually stripping
          functionality out of the Sharing service. The service normally scans a physical environment repeatedly in
          order to maintain and update
          its understanding, but our stakeholder analysis had revealed that this repeated scanning caused problems in
          a
          highly-trafficked environment. We wanted
          the Sharing service to scan the room only once (at the beginning of the session) and to forgot all physical
          environment data between presentations.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3> Client Walkthrough</h3>

      <p>At the end of the second week of sprints, we invited our two client stakeholders in to test our demo. We
        walked
        the client through our demo scenario and then allowed them to experiment with the menu system, voice chat, and shared AR object control.
      
        The client was pleased with the demo's capabilities, and authorized the creation of a full version of AR Presenter.

      <h3>Post-Demo Analysis</h3>
        
       However, even with this success, I still needed to assess the lessons learned from both the development and demonstration processes.  My analysis yielded the following insights:

            <p class="text-center">
              The client was particularly impressed with the demo's ability to have the presenter's actions immediately reflect on the presentee hologram.
              They quite clearly saw the power of AR Presenter as a controlled live experience.

              <p class="text-center">
                We had carefully sized the presentation controls to be easily usable via Hololens gestures, and placed the controls 
                so that the user could easily turn right to see them, without having them obscure the presentation content.  Client feedback
                on this arrangement was positive, confirming the correctness of the menu design.

                <p class="text-center">
                  The client was impressed by the immersive factor of our demo scenario, and was onboard with using AR Presenter to tell compelling narratives.

                    The client had difficulty knowing precisely where in the road scenario they should be looking at a particular time.
                    Future scenarios would need to be much more clear as to where the "action" was happening.

                      The client pointed out that left-handed users might be less comfortable with the right-positioned presentation controls.
                      We would need to offer a left-aligned menu as an option.

                      <p class="text-center">
                        The client stated a desire to have the presentation holograms be scalable, so that they could be adapted to the presentation area in use.

      <h3>Project Plan</h3>
      The final phase of my assignment was designing a project plan to govern the development of the full version of AR Presenter.  
      I suggested the full version be broken down into 3 main phases:

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Phase 1:  Demo clean-up and full presentation scenario:  </strong> In this phase, Fast Effect would implement the Standalone Mode, the Scaleable Holograms, and the Left-Handed Presentation Controls features.
        It would also work with the client to develop a full product demonstration scenario that the client could start using, even as the rest of the app was being developed.</li>
        <li><strong>Phase 2:  Parts Ecosystem Proof of Concept: </strong> In this phase, Fast Effect would develop all of the backend code required to support the Part Ecosystem, as well as developing a set of AR objects to demostrate 
        what this system could really do.</li>
        <li><strong>Phase 3:  "Safe Shared Environment" Finalization and Final UI Adjustments</strong>In this phase, Fast Effect would finalize the local network functionality required for the Safe Shared Experience Environment feature, 
        and would test this feature in an actual show venue.  Fast Effect would also use this phase to finalize any features that needed polish.</li>
      </ol>

      With this final deliverable, I had successfully completed my assignment.  Fast Effect and their client were well on 
      their way to developing a cutting-edge AR experience together.
