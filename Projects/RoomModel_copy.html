      <p><strong>Role:  </strong>UX Researcher &nbsp;|&nbsp; <strong>Duration: </strong> 4 Months
        <br>
        <strong>Tools Used:  </strong>AFrame Web AR Framework, Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator
        <br>
        <strong>UX Skills Used: </strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Summary: </strong> I was an academic UX researcher for a project sponsored by Mozilla and the University of Michigan. The overall aim
                of the project was to develop visions and future directions for the concept of a <strong> Mixed Reality internet
                  browser</strong>
                - a browser that can intermix traditional 2-D internet content with Augmented and Virtual Reality content.
        
                
                <br>
                <p>I worked on one question within this overall vision. <strong>How can we
                adapt everyday web technology CSS to control the look, behavior, and position of this AR content intelligently?</strong></p>

        <br>
        <strong>My Contributions: </strong> I made 3 main contributions to this project.  First, I <strong>developed the "Room Model"</strong> - a flexible model for intelligent AR object placement.
        Secondly, <strong>I developed a physics "playground"</strong> with which to explore the idea of controlling AR object layouts via simulated
        physics.  Finally, <strong>I merged the the Room Model and the Playground to create the "Physics CSS Browser"</strong> - a model that allows web programmers to control AR objects directly.

    <p>
     I worked as an academic researcher on a project sponsored by the University of Michigan.  The goal of the project was 
     to explore design concepts for a mixed reality browser - an internet browser designed to merge normal web content with
     Augmented Reality (AR) content.  My specific goal within the project was to develop a method by which web technology could 
     be used to directly control the size and positioning of AR objects.  Achieving this goal would allow anyone with web programming experience
     to use AR content.  The result of my work was the <strong>Physics CSS Browser</strong>.
     <br>
     <br>
     Here's the process I used to develop the Physics CSS Browser:
    </p>

    <h2>Explore</h2>
    <h3>Brainstorming</h3>

    <p>

    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used today to control the overall
        look and feel of webpages. However, in thinking about the concept of an XR Browser, it becomes obvious that
        today's CSS
        specifications dont cover the use of AR content integrated into the Web. For web programmers to integrate and
        control AR content using their
        existing skillsets, the CSS specifications need to be extended to cover AR. My goal for this project was to
        develop a vision of how this new specification
        would function.
    The AR Cube, like the Box Model before it, encloses content (in this case AR content) within a bounded area.
      The basics
      of the AR cube are quite similar to the Box model, with an inner "content" area, and an external border (which
      can be invisible or visible).
      However, even at this early stage, new, AR specific elements were worked in. For example, I was considering a
      concept in which the AR cube has a
      "forcefield" around item. This forcefield concept roughly corresponds to the "margin" property in CSS, as a
      preventative measure to ensure content pieces don't overlap with each other. The forcefield around a piece of AR
      content would "bounce" other AR content away from its designated area.
      <br>
      Even at this early stage, ideas like the forcefield showed how naturally the use of simulated physics fit into
      the mix of CSS extension. Use of physics
      would return multiple times over the course of the project.


      <br>
      <br>
      After building a concept for how each individual AR object might look in an extended CSS, it was time to develop
      how an
      entire room might look like. Fortunately, previous research into "spatial AR" (Thomas et al. 2014) helped
      develop a concept.
      In the concept of spatial AR, all AR content in a physical space is anchored above flat surfaces such as tables.
      Placing AR objects near surfaces like these
      gives users specific locations and context that helps them understand how the AR object works.
      <br>
      <br>
      Taking the idea of spatial AR and applying to the concept of CSS AR Extensions, I developed the core concept of
      the Room Model - also a model about spatial placement based on context.
      The Room Model is built around the concept of <strong>anchors</strong>. Anchors refer to physical objects in a
      given environment that have some kind of context with which
      to justify placing an AR object near. In keeping with spatial AR, tables are the most common example of anchors.
      However, the Room Model posits the idea of
      a wider variety of anchors. Posters, windows, monitors, and light sources are all additional examples of anchor
      type. The Room Model further posits that specific types
      of anchors afford different AR interactions to be controlled with CSS. A table might have a volumetric cube
      hovering above it, a poster might have plane-shaped AR placed above it, etc.

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-2"></div>
        <div class="col-8">
          <figure href="/assets/RoomModel/window_sketch.jpg" class="figure" data-toggle="lightbox"
          data-footer="Brainstorming sketch of the “Window” anchor type, and what
          kinds of styling options it might have.">
            <img src="/assets/RoomModel/window_sketch.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Brainstorming sketch of the “Window” anchor type, and what
              kinds of styling options it might have.</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>
        <div class="col-2"></div>
      </div>

      Here is an example of one specific type of anchor - one built to overlay a physical window. This "window anchor"
      is shaped as a 2-D plane, in keeping
      with the idea that a see-through window is usable on either side. The window anchor has two unique behaviors to
      be controlled by CSS. The first is the ability to "flip"
      the AR content in order to reverse what AR content is being shown on each side of the window. The second unique
      behavior is to control if the window anchor is in fact double-sided, or if only one side of
      the plane should have active AR content.</p>
