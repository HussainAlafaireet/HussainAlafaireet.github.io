      <h1>VR Diorama - A more hands-on way of prototyping VR Experiences</h1>


      <h2>Project Overview - A Procedurally Generated VR Maze With Dynamic Clues</h2>

      <h3>*Note* - This is an in-progress project. </h3>
      <br>

      <h2>Project Intro - Closing the gap in VR Prototyping</h2>
      <p>This project was born initially out of my own experiences attempting to prototype VR experience. I've tried
        multiple methods
        of prototyping, as well as looking at the VR prototyping landscape. Tessa Chung's Medium <a
          href="https://medium.com/inborn-experience/strategies-for-vr-prototyping-810e0d3aa21d">article</a> provides a
        really good look as to the overall landscape of VR prototyping.
        However, here's how I personally see the breakdown of existing prototyping methods, in terms of advantages and
        disadvantages:

        <ol>
          <li><strong>2-D Sketching: </strong>This method, as always, is our old standby. 2-D Sketching has its usual
            advantages of quickly being able to create prototype, having minimal
            costs, and having a lower skill threshold for UX professionals. However, due to the 3-D nature of VR
            applications, 2-D sketching often fails to convey the full experience of a proposed
            VR environment, which pretty strongly limits its effectiveness as a VR prototyping tool. </li>
          <li>"<strong>"2.5-D" Sketching: </strong> These prototyping methods are ones that use 2-D sketching as a base,
            but then add some electronic tools
            to be able to run the sketches inside of a VR Headset. An example of this is <a
              href="https://medium.com/inborn-experience/vr-sketches-56599f99b357">Volodymyr Kurbatov's</a> 3-D grid
            (which can be loaded into a 360-video viewer). These methods try to provide
            the "best of both worlds" by offering the flexibility of sketching with the simulation and impression of
            depth that a headset-based, first-person POV proivdes. However, this approach has disadvantages too. The
            sketching involved
            requires more skill, as the sketcher needs to draw the objects with the correct positioning and size to
            convery the impressesion of distance. The addition of a tool to route the image to the headset itself
            requires a skillset (and time). And finally, most of the implementations
            of this type of prototyping don't let the user walk around "in" the sketch (though I have seen one
            academic-based implementation that does allow this to a degree).
          </li>
          <li><strong>Diorama: </strong>This approach works by building a physical diorama of the intended virtual
            environment. This approach has the advantage of creating
            a strong understanding of the general look-and-feel that the eventual virtual environment will have, which
            makes it a powerful prototyping tool for VR. However, this approach also has its disadvantages. Building a
            diorama may require a certain level of skill, depending on the fidelity of the details desired. Secondly,
            you lose the
            flexbility of setching, and you may not be able to adjust your diorama quickly. Finally, a diorama might
            give you insight on overall look-and-feel, but not necessarily on interactions. </li>
          <li><strong>"2.5-D" Wireframing: </strong> This approach is similar to the "2.5-D" sketching approach, but
            uses 360 photos, and professional-looking interface mockups to provide a much
            more realistic look and feel. The addition of the more finished evidence contributes to a much stronger
            understanding of look and feel. However, you lose the flexibility and on-the-fly adjustability with this
            approach. </li>
          <li><strong>"Grayboxing": </strong>This approach involves creating placeholder 2-D and 3-D assets, and placing
            them in an initial virtual environment (such as a basic AFrame or Unity scene). This approach has the best
            representation of all the prototyping methods, since it's basically building an initial version of the
            eventual virtual environment. However, this method takes the most time/effort to create, and requires 3-D
            content and game engine skillsets that not all UX practitioners will have. It's also typically not feasible
            to update this type of prototype on the fly in response to comments during a live usability/user experience
            test. </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <h2>Prototyping Methods: Whats the Gap, and How Do We Close It? </h2>
      <p>The way that I see it, UX professionals wanting to prototype VR experiences are missing a prototyping method
        that achieves the following combination of advantages:
        <ol>
          <li>Can be adjusted on the fly during an actual discussion with a potential end-user.</li>
          <li>Does not require skillsets in 3-D content creation/game engine expertise.</li>
          <li>Still conveys a strong impression of what the eventual virtual environment and its associated interactions
            will look and feel like.</li>
        </ol>

        The "VR Diorama" is my proposed method for closing this prototyping gap.
      </p>

      <h2>VR Diorama: The Basic Concept</h2>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-2"></div>
        <div class="col-8">
          <figure href="/assets/VR_Diorama/vr_diorama_base_sketch.jpg" class="figure" data-toggle="lightbox"
            data-footer="VR Diorama main concept sketch">
            <img src="/assets/VR_Diorama/vr_diorama_base_sketch.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">
              VR Diorama main concept sketch
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>
        <div class="col-2"></div>
      </div>

      <p>The VR Diorama is a prototyping method built around a diorama that's built into a fascimile of a VR headset.
        The headset can then be worn by an end-user to get a first-person POV of the proposed virtual experience. Key
        features of the diorama include:
        <ul>
          <li>An open/openable top for on-the-fly diorama reconfiguration</li>
          <li>Slots for paper backdrop and floor inserts to quickly establish an overall theme for the environment.</li>
          <li>A magnet-base attachment system to anchor diorama elements to the bottom of the headset.</li>
          <li>"User Interface" mockups placed on mini-stands to simulate interactions.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>VR Diorama Build Plans</h2>
      <p>My current plan for creating the initial version of the diorama is as follows:
        
      <ol>
        <li>Measure my Oculus Rift headset as a template for the sizing of the VR Diorama</li>
        <li>Create a traced pattern for the construction of the VR Diorama</li>
        <li>Use the pattern to create the initial VR Diorama frame out out of cardboard.</li>
        <li>Experiment with the magnet method to see how firmly it can be used to attached diorama elements</li>
        <li>Build a full diorama scene with various elements, including backdrop and floor material.</li>
        <li>Test with other UX professionals to determine if this prototyping method is a) feasible, and b) actually provides the advantages I anticipate</li>
      </ol>
