      <h1>Literature Reflection: "Usability engineering of virtual environments (VEs): identifying multiple criteria
        that drive effective VE system design"</h1>

      <h2>Stanney, Mollaghasemi, Reeves, Breaux, & Graeber, 2003</h2>

      <h3>The Main Ideas</h3>
      <p>
        This article covers the characteristisc and backend methodology behind the Multi-criteria Assessment of
        Usability for Virtual Environments (MAUVE), a technique for
        systematically assessing the usability of VR environments. MAUVE is intended to cover a set of perceived gaps in
        applying traditional usability techniques in VR:

        <ol>
          <li>VR interactions often don't resemble the traditional "point and click" interactions of typical software.
          </li>
          <li>VR applications typically use multiple modes of output simultaneously, and traditional usabiliy techniques
            don't consider this fusion of output.</li>
          <li>VR applications require a strong sense of immersion and presence to be effective. Traditional usability
            methods don't assess these characteristics directly.</li>
          <li>VR system interaction performance can't be adequately measured by the time/accuracy metrics that are the
            gold standard for traditional UX.</li>
          <li>Traditional usability assessment lacks coverage on multiple users in a shared VR environment.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <h4>The MAUVE Model</h4>

      </div>

      <p>The MAUVE technique is built around a hierarchical model of the usability characteristics associated with VR
        environments.
        This model, in this UX professional's assessment, is the most valuable component of the article, as the model
        provides a comprehensive way of
        thinking about VR usability. The individual model components break down as follows:
      </p>

      <h5>VE System Interface</h5>
      <p>The VE System Interfaces characteristic refer to the software and hardware characteristics present in any VR
        environment design.</p>
      <h6>Interaction</h6>
      <p>This characteristic covers the interactions users can engage a VR environment with. Overall, the idea here is
        that
        users can engage in basically two types of activities: they can move with the virtual environment, or they can
        interact with an object in the environment.
        MAUVE more specifically breaks down Interaction into the following sub-areas:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Wayfinding: </strong>Wayfinding refers to the users ability to create a mental map of the virtual
            environment, tell where they are within the environment,
            and how well the user can make decisions about where to go next. Usabiliy considerations for wayfinding
            include the correct use of visual cues in the environment (such as the clear usages of paths and landmarks),
            as well as the availability of navigation
            aids (such as a map or virtual signage).
          </li>
          <li><strong>Navigation: </strong>Navigation refers to the users ability to actually move in the virtual
            environment, once they decide where to go. Usability considerations in this area are only lightly discussed
            in the article,
            but include such considerations as accuracy of movement, how natural the movement feels, and how streamlined
            the interaction is.</li>
          <li><strong>Object Selection and Manipulation: </strong>This characteristic refers to the users abilty to
            select and manipulate objects within the VR environments. Usability considersations relative to this this
            characteristic include
            the degree of realism used, the modifications made to virtual objects to make manipulation easier (such as
            altering the color of an object when selecting), and the accuracy of the virtual environments user gesture
            tracking. Stanney et al. also note that the utter lack of standardization in
            conventions for how object selection/manipulation is implemented contributes to usability issues.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h6>Multi-Modal System Output</h6>
      <p>This characteristic covers the various output methods VR environments use to convey information and feedback to
        users. This characteristic
        can be broken down into the following sub-characteristics:

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Visual Output: </strong>This characteristic refers to the visual presentation of information
            within the virtual environment. Usability considerations
            within this area include primarily the technical decision made to support visual output, such as the screen
            resolution, the width of the users field of view, and the refresh rate of the visual display.</li>
          <li><strong>Auditory output: </strong>This refers to the audio presentation of information in the virtual
            environment. Usability considerations in this area include the
            quality of the spatial positioning of audio content, the effect the users surrounding environmet has on the
            audio content, and the use of audio in conjunction with visual output.</li>
          <li><strong>Haptic Output: </strong>This characteristic refers to the use of tactile or force feedback. The
            article does not go into deep detail into the
            specific usability concerns in this area.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h5>VE User Interface</h5>
      <p>
        The VE User Interface characteristic refers to the human physical and mental considerations that should be
        accounted for in VR design.
        Note that the terminology used for this characteristic can be a little misleading when considered in the context
        of general usability discussion.
        "User Interface" in traditional usability discussion often refers to the actual Graphical User Interface (GUI),
        which, in the MAUVE model, falls under the "Interaction"
        characteristic of VE System Interface.
      </p>
      <h6>Engagement</h6>
      <p>This characteristic refers to the VR environments ability to encourage and motivate the user to focus on the
        virtual environment, and suspend their
        sense of disbelief. This characteristic can be broken down into the following sub-characteristics:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Presence: </strong>While a notoriously hard term to define precisely, this article defines
            presence as "the subjective perception of experiencing oneself as being in a computergenerated environment
            rather than in one’s actual physical location" (Stanney et al. 2003). The article notes that while many in
            the VR space assume that
            presence is needed to make a VR environment effective, there was little systematic evidence at the time the
            article was written to support this. Under the premise that presence is in fact needed,
            usability considerations such as the realism of environment details, the ease of interaction with the
            environment, and the amount and nature of user-initiated control the environment provides.
          <li><strong>Immersion: </strong>Immersion refers to the ability of the VR environment to isolate the user from
            the actual physicial environment they are in, creating the impression that the virtual
            environment is the only environment that currently exists. Usability considerations in this area include how
            well the physical hardware isolates the user, how natural the interactions feel,
            ad how available environmental visual/audio output is to create the impression of a true environment.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h6>Side Effects</h6>
      <p>
        This characteristic covers the various side effects that VR environments can impart on their users. This
        characteristics can be broken down
        into the following sub-characteristics:

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Comfort: </strong>Comfort, in this context, refers to the general presence of physical comfort and
            safety can provide. Usability concerns within this area include avoiding using incorrectly designed depth
            cues, as well as color contrast and illumination issues.</li>
          <li><strong>Sickness: </strong>This characteristics refers primarily to the VR-triggerd motion sickness that
            affects a substantial portion of the potential user population. MAUVE break the Sickness category down into
            a variety of discrete symptoms that can be used as assessment criteria. </li>
          <li><strong>After-effects: </strong>This characteristic is distinct in that it covers a set of
            non-cybersickness related after effects that can occur due to needing to readjust
            to the real world from VR. This symptoms include head-spinning and reduced hand-eye coordination.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h4>MAUVE Model Usability Question Breakdown</h4>
      <p>
        After the model breakdown, the article provides a set of MAUVE-related
        usability concern questions that usability practioners could use
        to break down a VR product's usability experience. These questions are categorized by the various sub-sections
        of the
        MAUVE model, and are usually derived from another scholarly source. This summary won't replicate the complete
        list of questions,
        as the list is quite extensive, but a selection of the more interested/insightful questions are provided below:

        <ul>
          <li>Is point-to-point navigation cumbersome and slow? Does it support acquisition of survey knowledge</li>
          <li>Does system avoid use of mode-based navigation where only locomotion is allowed?</li>
          <li>.
            Non-body centered devices (e.g. mice, joystick) that hamper object manipulation should not be used</li>
          <li>The dominant hand should be assigned to fine-grained object manipulation</li>
          <li>When selecting distant objects via direct manipulation, size, appearance, and inter-object distance
            should be effectively exaggerated </li>
        </ul>

      </p>

      <h4>MAUVE Tooling Usability Test</h4>
      <p>The final sections of the article discuss the details of how MAUVE might actually be used by a usability
        practitioner. The authors envision using a heuristic evaluation as the basis for a MAUVE evaluation of a VR
        environment (heuristic evaluation being an evaluation where a usability practioner reviews a product based on a
        known set of usability standards).
        In the case of MAUVE, the authors developed a Visual Basic assistive evaluation program that allows a usability
        practitioner to specify numeric importance levels for each characteristic in the
        MAUVE model. The program then uses the usability questions discussed above to walk the usability practitioner
        through the assessment how well the VR environment in question performs for each assessment,
        again providing a numeric rating. The MAUVE program then uses a statistical process called analytic hierarchy
        process (AHP) (Saaty, 1977, 1980, 1994) to derive an overall numeric usability rating based on the importance
        factors given.
      </p>



      <h3>Connections</h3>
      This article is very much in the theme of Sutcliffe and Kaur (2000) , in that is tries to provide an overall
      framework combined with a look at how the framework might be used in practice. Both articles use Nielsen's 10
      heuristics as a basis for their frameworks,
      and both provide a series of questions based on their model to get usability practitioners thinking in the right
      direction.


      <h3>Personal Reflection</h3>
      <p>
        I found that MAUVE model has the distinct advanatage of comprehensive coverage. The primary use of the model
        will be as a framing approach for thinking logically
        about VR usability, with a major advantage being that the model is hierarchical. Much of user research benefits
        from having a logical flow for how you're going to actually perform the research, and the MAUVE model's
        hierarchy
        supports that to a degree, by basically walking the practioner through the process. <br><br>

        Where I have some concerns is the potential complexity of the model, and what appears to be an immediate need
        for tooling to support the usability assessment process.
        I fear that the focus on putting in numeric weights/rating, and the focus on a numeric rating as the primary
        output, obscure the "what" of the potential usability problem. I'm not sure
        The MAUVE tooling as proposed provides limited understanding on what should be done to fix usability problems
        found in the process, and that places a pretty big burden on the usability practioner.

      </p>
      <h3>Follow-up Sources</h3>
      <p>
        Since the tooling for the MAUVE model is primarily based on AHP, it would behoove me to review that particular statistical process (Saaty, 1977, 1980, 1994).
        I should also review the sources used to derive the various usability questions/concerns used as the basis for MAUVE heuristic evaluation (from my perspective, the most useful part of the article).
