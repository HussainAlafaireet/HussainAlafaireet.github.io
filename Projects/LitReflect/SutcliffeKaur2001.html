      <h1>Literature Reflection: "Evaluating the usability of virtual reality user interfaces"</h1>

      <h2>Sutcliffe, A. G., & Kaur, K. D. (2000)</h2>

      <h3>The Main Ideas</h3>
      <p>
        This article consists of 3 main topics. Firstly, Sutcliffe and Kaur (2000) discuss a 3-part model for framing VR
        usability concerns.
        Secondly, the authors discuss how to use this model to create a cognitive walkthrough of a prospective VR
        application to find usability problems within it. Finally,
        Sutcliffe and Kaur (2000) briefly discuss a real-life use case of the walkthrough method, as well as an
        evaluation of their model by VR designers.</p>

      <h4>VR Interaction Model</h4>
      <p>The interaction model Sutcliffe and Kaur (2000) propose for framing a VR experience is separated into 3 cycles
        of VR user behaviors. The first cycle is the <strong>task based activity</strong>. This is the cycle
        that users employ when they want to accomplish a task in VR. This cycle consists of forming a goal, locating and
        moving to the VR objects that relate to that goal, actually use those objects, and then interpret any resulting
        feedback from the environment
        to determine if the goal/sub-goal has been achieved.
        <br>
        <br>
        The second cycle in the interaction model is the <strong>exploration</strong> cycle. This is the cycle that is
        used when the users goal is to explore the virtual environment.
        Sutcliffe and Kaur (2000) break this cycle down into main paths, based on how directed the exploration actually
        is. If the user is free-romaing the environment without a specific goal in mind,
        the cycle consists of scanning the environment, deciding on a direction to move in, actually moving in that
        direction, and then observing the change in the user's view after the environment. Sutcliffe and Kaur (2000)
        also incorporate points of interest into this
        sub-cycle. If a user sees an object that interests them, they can either note the item in their memory for later
        use, or explore the object via direct manipulation.
        <br>
        <br>
        The second sub-cycle in the exploration cycle is goal-based exploration. In this sub-cycle, the user stars with
        a particular thing they want to find, and builds a search plan for moving through the
        environment to find it. The user then moves through the same scan-direction-navigate-observe cycle that the
        freeroam explanation cycle has, but with the search target as an endpoint to the exploration.
        <br>
        <br>
        The final cycle in Sutcliffe and Kaur (2000)'s model is the <strong>systen initiative</strong> cycle. This is
        when the VR application system itself takes some kind of action that the user must then
        react to. In this cycle, the user first recognizes that the system is taking some kind of action. The users then
        decides if they want to allow the action to continue to the end, or if they want to interrupt it and
        regain control. If the user allows the action, they simply observe and interpret the system actions, and then
        react once the action is complete. If the user decides to interrupt, they will then pick how and when to
        interupt, and then carry that interruption out.
      </p>
      <h4>Walkthrough Design</h4>
      <p>The second main part of the article discussion building a <strong>cogntiive walkthrough</strong> using the
        discussed interaction model as a basis.
        A cognitive walkthrough is a usability analysis in which a UX practitioner developers a series of likely tasks
        for a given application, and then executes those tasks on the application, looking for
        potential usability problems along the way. The most pertinent information in this section of the article is a
        series of general usability questions associated with each main cycle in the interaction model.
        This questions, while still very high-level, expose the core usability concerns Sutcliffe and Kaur (2000) have
        formulated in their model. This report will capture the main questions by task cycle below, as this area is the
        main takeaway from the article:
      </p>
      <h4>Task-Based Action Walkthrough Questions</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Can the user form or remember the task goal?</li>
        <li>Can the user specify an intention of what to do?</li>
        <li>Are the objects or part of the environment necessary to carry out the task-action visible?</li>
        <li>Can the objects necessary for task action be located?</li>
        <li>Can the users approach and orient themselves to the object so that the necessary action can be carried out?
        </li>
        <li>Can the user decide what action to take and how?</li>
        <li>Can the user carry out the manipulation or action easily?</li>
        <li>Is the consequence of the user's action visible?</li>
        <li>Can the user interpret the change?</li>
        <li>Can the user decide what to do next?</li>
      </ol>
      <h5>Goal-Directed Exploration Walkthrough Questions</h5>
      <ol>
        <li>Does the user know where to start looking?</li>
        <li>Can the user determine a pathway towards the search target?</li>
        <li>Can the user execute movement and navigation actions?</li>
        <li>Can the user recognize the search target?</li>
        <li>Can the user find a location of interest again?</li>
      </ol>
      <h5>Freeroam Exploration Walkthrough Questions</h5>
      <ol>
        <li>Can the user determine a pathway for movement?</li>
        <li>Can the user execute movement and navigation actions?</li>
        <li>Can the user recognize objects in the environment?</li>
        <li>Can users interpret the identity, role and behavior of objects?</li>
        <li>Can the user remember important objects or locations?</li>
      </ol>
      <h5>System Initiative Walkthrough Questions</h5>
      <ol>
        <li>Is it clear to the user that the system has taken
          control?</li>
        <li>Are the effects of system actions visible and recognizable?</li>
        <li>Are system actions interpretable?</li>
        <li>Can the user decide what to do next?</li>
        <li>Is the end of system action clear?</li>
        <li>Can the user resume control and is the appropriate action clear?</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Case Study Evaluation of Model/Walkthrough Method</h3>
        <p>This report will not cover the Case Study section of the article in depth, as there isn't much content
          in the article itself. Sutcliffe and Kaur (2000) reference a secondary article that covers the case study
          evaluation in more depth (Kaur et al 1999), so
          I will save the evaluation discussion for a mini-report on that article.
        </p>
        <h3>Connections</h3>
        <p>This is the initial article in the mini-report list, so direct connections will be limited this time around.
          The most obvious connection is to Don Norman's user experience work, with particular focus on the Gulf of
          Evaluation/Gulf of Execution. These two models of
          user behavior focus on the users ability to a) figure out what they should do to achieve a goal, and b)
          execute on that goal. Users can get derailed at multiple points in either of these two
          processes. The model presented by Sutcliffe and Kaur (2000) unpack and make more explicit Gulf of
          Evaluation/Execution concerns as they relate specifically to virtual environments.
          This is an approach guarunteed to be useful, but with the disadvantage of being really high-level. The
          questions would ultimately need to be translated into specific design practices for
          different types of virtual environments and interaction methods. The model/walkthrough questions are best
          viewed as an initial way to wrap ones head around the the potential
          usability considerations of a virtual environment.
        </p>
        <h3>Personal Reflection</h3>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Follow-up Sources</h3>
        <p>The primary follow-up source here is the Kaur et al. (1999) article, as that contains the actual case study
          evaluation work. This article
          should give insight into how the 3-cycle model could practically be used.
