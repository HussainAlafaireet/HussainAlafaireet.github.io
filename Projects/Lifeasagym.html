        <strong>Summary: </strong> <strong>Life as a Gym (LG)</strong> is a set of Internet-connected AR glasses that
        help busy University students
        maintain
        exercise routines. LG <strong>scans the users environment</strong> during their daily routines, and identifies
        opportunities for on-the-spot exercise. LG coordinates its suggestions with the users schedule,
        <strong>seemlessly
          inserting exercise into
          the users lives</strong>.



        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>My Contributions: </strong> I worked with three other UX Designers to develop the design prototype
        for LG.  I was the <strong>team lead for the project</strong>, leading
        the design vision, and establishing the timetable for all activities. I was also a <strong>primary UX
          Designer/Researcher</strong> for the project. As designer, <strong>I crafted the core concept
          of LG</strong>. As researcher, I helped develop all user research for the project. Finally, <strong>I was the
          developer of
          the LG prototype</strong>, utilizing AR prototyping tools to create a compelling demonstration
        of our design.

    <p>
      I worked with three other UX professionals on a design challenge that resulted in <strong>Life as a Gym (LG):
        AR smart glasses to support exercise in the life of a busy University student.</strong>
      LG works by scanning the environment in the users vicinity, and finding opportunities for informal exercise
      routines. By marrying these exercise scans with an understanding of the users' schedule,
      LG makes finding the time and place for exercise effortless.
      <br>
      <br>
      We had 4 months to design and create our prototype, with a demonstration session in front of stakeholders as the final target.
      <br>
      <br>
      Here's <strong>the process we used</strong> to design LG:

    <h2>Ideation</h2>

    <h3>Defining Problem Space</h3>

    <p>

      This design challenge allowed us the freedom to develop a smart device design for any domain we wished.
      <strong>Our first
        step was to define the problem we wanted to address with our design</strong>.
      We began by brainstorming problems together, and then recognizing common threads in the brainstorming. Our common
      threads were built based on our collective previous experiences as University
      students. <strong>Our common desire was to create a device that would address one of the many health concerns that
        University students face.</strong>
    </p>

    <h3>Brainstorming</h3>

    <p> Once we had defined <strong>University Student Health</strong> as our overall problem, we began developing
      initial design concepts to further refine the problem space. As
      we
      developed our concepts, we noticed that,
      in addition to the University health scoping, we were also coming up with functionality that revolved around
      <strong>memory</strong> and the <strong>use of reminders</strong>
      to manage one's activity. </p>

          </figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-2"></div>
      <div class="col-8">

      <div class="col-8">

      </div>
      <div class="col-2"></div>
    </div>


    <p>
      Based on the two brainstorming pillars of <strong>University Student Health</strong> and
      <strong>Reminders</strong> we developed several
      more
      fleshed-out concepts. My contribution to the concept pool
      was a <strong>smart gym concept</strong>:
    </p>


    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-2"></div>
      <div class="col-8">
        <figure href="/assets/LG/ms1_smart_gym.jpg" class="figure" data-toggle="lightbox"
          data-footer="Concept sketches for the area of health reminders">
          <img src="/assets/LG/ms1_smart_gym.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
          <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Smart Gym concept sketch</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
      <div class="col-2"></div>
    </div>

    <p>Once again, we began to notice trends in our brainstorming. We found that <strong>exercise was a common concern
        in our design.</strong> We therefore refined our problems space to
      <strong>Helping University Students manage their exercise time</strong>. We anticipated, based on our own
      experience, that University students faced many challenges in working
      exercise into their daily routines.
    </p>

    <h2>Research</h2>

    <p>Now that we had an refined problem space developed, we began <strong>developing a user research plan</strong> to
      better understand the challenges associated
      with exercise time management. We first developed <strong>our core research questions</strong> for the study.

      <h3>Research Questions</h3>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-4">
          <img src="/assets/LG/Icons/emotions.png" alt="" class="mx-auto d-block img-fluid">
          <h4 class="text-center"><small>What motivates the target audience to exercise?</small></h4>
          <p>This question was targeted at learning <strong>what factors got our users to actually exercise</strong>.
            Our design could
            then work at enhancing these motivations.</p>

          <h4 class="text-center"><small>What factors prevent target audience from exercising?</small></h4>
          <p class="text-center">This question was targeted at learning <strong>what barriers prevented our users from
              exercising</strong>. Our design could
            then work at breaking down these barriers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-4">
          <img src="/assets/LG/Icons/lost.png" alt="" class="mx-auto d-block img-fluid">
          <h4 class="text-center"><small>How does target audience learn how to exercise?</small></h4>
          <p class="text-center">This question was targeted at understanding <strong>whether our audience was learning
              to do
              exercises correctly and
              efficiently</strong>. Our design could be targeted at learning how
            to perform exercise more easily, leading to a greater likelihood of actually exercising.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row">

          <h4 class="text-center"><small>What kinds of exercises does our target audience actually do?</small></h4>
          <p class="text-center">By understanding <strong>what exercises our target audience tended to use</strong>, we
            could narrow the
            focus of our design
            to support those exercises specifically.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-4">
          <img src="/assets/LG/Icons/addiction.png" alt="" class="mx-auto d-block img-fluid">
          <h4 class="text-center"><small>What resources does our target audience use to enable their exercise?</small>
          </h4>
          <p class="text-center">With this question, we wanted to understand <strong>what tools users were already using
              to
              enable their
              exercise routines</strong>, and what flaws those resources had. Our design
            could then address those flaws.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-2"></div>
      </div>


      <h3>Study Design</h3>

      <p>To determine the answers to our research questions, we <strong>designed two complimentary studies</strong>:
      </p>
      <br>

      <div class=row>
        <div class="col-6">
          <img src="/assets/LG/lg_diarydesign.png" alt="" class="mx-auto d-block img-fluid">

        <div class="col-6">
          <img src="/assets/LG/lg_surveydesign.png" alt="" class="mx-auto d-block img-fluid">
        </div>
      </div>

      <br>



      <h3>Research Analysis</h3>
      <p> We had a rough mapping of survey and diary questions relative to their corresponding research question. To
        analysis our results, we first tabulated our quantitative
        data and performed light affinity wall analysis to categorize our qualitative data from the diary. We then
        formalized this mapping during our post-survey analysis, directly relating the results of each study
        question
        back
        to a core research question.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-2"></div>
        <div class="col-8">
          <figure href="/assets/LG/ms2_data_whiteboard.jpg" class="figure" data-toggle="lightbox"
            data-footer="Extended mapping of survey results to research questions">
            <img src="/assets/LG/ms2_data_whiteboard.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Extended mapping of survey results to research
              questions

          </figure>
        </div>
        <div class="col-2"></div>
      </div>


      <p>By having this mapping viewable on a whiteboard as a whole, we were also able to
        see
        patterns between the different activities and questions, which lead us to <strong>three core insights:</strong>
      </p>

              Significant amount of discussion

      <h4>Final Design Selection</h4>
      <p>
        We <strong>selected the Life as a Gym concept</strong> for two main reasons. Firstly, we felt that out of our
        three
        solutions, the glasses best addressed
        the <strong>primary consideration of time management</strong>. Secondly, we were the most interested in the
        concept from a
        creative standpoint, due to the futuristic nature
        of using <strong>AR technology to enable physical exercise</strong>.</p>

      <h3>User Enactments</h3>



      <p>Thanks to our initial user studies, we had a solid understanding of the primary factors affecting how
        our
        target audience approaches physical exercise,
        and "Life as a Gym" (LG) - a design concept that directly addressed those factors. However, we knew we
        needed <strong>user input to understand the exact set of features LG should have</strong>.
        <br>
        <br>

        To determine
        these features,
        we we <strong>decided to conduct User Enactments</strong> - sessions where users experience the concept by
        acting out likely scenarios
        for LG use.
        User Enactments were extremely helpful for our specific concept because
        LG
        revolved around a new technology that many people have yet to interact with.

        <h3>User Enactment Analysis</h3>
        <p>In order to analyze all of the data we collected, we <strongcreated affinity notes></strong> from each user
            and for each
            scenario, and then <strong>constructed an affinity wall</strong> to categorize them. <a

            <p class="text-center">According to our research, <strong>users feel uncomfortable with involving their

                LG activities</strong>.
              Most
              of them would not use this feature in social settings. Therefore, we decided to <strong>focus on
                individual
                usage scenarios</strong>
            </p>

            <p class="text-center">We found that most users <strong>were comfortable with walking, running, or climbing
                as public activities</strong>.
              Therefore,

              reduce the text in our app to a minimum amount, and place text to the side of the users central view.</p>

            the daily non-exercise routine of a university student</strong>. As the student goes about their daily
          exercise
          activity, the system will scan their calendar system and compare it with location data to generate
          ad-hoc
          walking/running routines that still fit with the students schedule.
          <br>

        <h2>Prototype</h2>

        <p>
          Now that we had our overall design concept in place, complete with user input on specific feature
          areas,
          <strong>we began building a prototype</strong> to demonstrate LG.
         
        </p>



        <h3>Prototype Construction</h3>

        <p>

          As the resident AR expert on the team, I was the one primarily responsible for the design and implementation
          of the
          initial
          prototype. As we had 4 weeks to develop a
          demonstration prototype, my plan was to <strong>create a "Wizard of Oz" prototype</strong> that would simulate the actual
          intended
          experience.




          To do this, <strong>I built an AR app using AFrame (a web-based AR/VR framework), and AR.JS (a free AR utility library)</strong>.  This app would <strong>simulate the LG experience using an ordinary smartphone</strong>.
          The app ran on a webpage that the phone would access via a standard browser.  The app accessed the phone's camera to create a live video feed.  The webpage could also layer 
          several configurations of user interface elements on top of the video feed.  Each UI configuration represented a particular feature of LG.  These configurations could be switched by a tap on the phone screen.

          <br>
          <br>
          This setup allowed us to <strong>create a convincing demonstration of LG via a video livestream from the phone</strong>.
          By holding the phone at head-height, switching between the UI configurations, and livestreaming the phone output,
          we created a demonstration of the LG design concept with convincing fidelity.

              <p class="text-center">
                  We found that both the <strong>promotional video and the Wizard-of-Oz livestream communicated our design effectively</strong>, due to the use 
                  of first-person view.  In addition, we found that both mockup methods could <strong>generate a demo prototype in short amounts of time</strong>.

                <p class="text-center">
                  <strong>Our user enactments were easily the most effective research methods</strong> used in our project.  The in-depth discussion they sparked allowed us to isolate 
                  features and issues we would never have thought of ourselves.

                  <p class="text-center">
                    We found that the <strong>early use of initial designs allowed us to inform our initial research design</strong>, which then fed back into our next design steps.
                    Repeating this process over and over ensured that all of our activities had a basis that would lead to success.

                <p class="text-center">
                  Our attempts to use sketches as the basis of our user enactments had only limited success in conveying the experience of LG.  We 
                had to <strong>verbally explain concepts of our design far more than expected</strong>.  In addition, we found that holding sketches during the enactment caused users to
                focus on the test facilitators, which may have <strong>biased our users towards using voice input</strong>.

                    <strong>Enactment users discussed safety issues</strong> regarding attention direction in busy environments, privacy concerns, and late-night street usage.  While 
                    we took these issues into account when building the final LG design, our modifications remain untested in terms of actually providing safety.

                    <p class="text-center">
                     Our original intent was to have a Wizard-of-Oz <strong>prototype based on a physical set of glasses</strong> that Final Demo attendees could try themselves.  This 
                     plan proved to be infeasible due to unforseen technical challenges.  While our livestream mock-up worked well, we still felt that a physical prototype would have 
                     conveyed our vision to a greater degree.
