      <h1>Life as AR Glasses - Exercise Guidance for a Busy Lifestyle</h1>

      <h2>Project Overview - Smart Glasses that encourage exercise in a busy life through thoughtful time management and
        a
        deep understanding of one’s lifestyle </h2>
      <p>
        I worked with four other UX professionals to prototype <strong>Life As a Gym (LG)</strong>, an innovative method
        to encourage University students to add more exercise
        to their already-filled lives. LG glasses are enhanced with augmented reality that scans a user’s environment
        for ad-hoc exercise opportunities, such as stairs to climb, places to jog, etc. LG glasses then inform their
        users to these exercise opportunities and guides the users to them. LG manages these ad-hoc opportunities to the
        users’ schedule, giving them the confidence to exercise, knowing that they will still make it to their next stop
        on time.

      <h2>My Contributions - Timeslines, User Research, and Prototype Coding </h2>
      <p>
        My primary contributions to this project were as follows:
        <ol>
          <li>Managed the overall group activity as team lead, balancing workload and defining timetables.</li>
          <li>Acted as one of the primary designers and facilitators of the user research used.</li>
          <li>Developed the live Wizard-of-Oz demo of LG utilizing the AFrame AR/VR web framework, along with the AR.js
            AR library.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <h2>Problem to be Solved - How do we get University students to actually exercise regularly? </h2>

      Our motivation for creating LG was a combination of several different factors. Prior to deciding to go with Life
      as
      a Gym glasses as our concept, we conducted background research in various topics; one of the statistics we found
      was approximately 40-50% of all college students do not get the recommended amount of physical activity, that is,
      they do not do enough physical activity in a given day to constitute exercise from a medical perspective. This
      statistic was a driving force throughout our project and stuck with us as one of our key motivations throughout
      the course.
      <p></p>


      <h2>Initial Ideation and Scoping - Health...And Memory</h2>

      <p>
        Our original goal for this design challenge was extremely high-level. We knew we wanted to prototype a smart
        device, and we wanted to
        have that device support University student health, as that was a challenge we had all faced at one time or
        another. To get our ideas flowing, and
        to point some firmer bounds around the scope of the project, we engaged in an initial ideation session. As we
        developed our concepts, we noticed that,
        in addition to the Unversity health scoping, we were also coming up with functionality that revolved around
        memory and the use of reminders
        to manage one's activity.

      <p>
        Based on the two brainstorming pillars of "University student health" and "reminders" we developed several more
        fleshed-out concepts. My contribution to the concept pool
        was a smart gym concept:
      </p>

      <h3>Smart Gym</h3>

      <p>This concept is a gym with health-monitoring capabilities to maximize the time and effort of off-campus
        students who will have a limited window to both learn and use the gym. The concept included the following
        primary features:

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Easy Login: </strong>A login board that accepts the student’s University ID. Tied to that ID is
            the student’s gym history. When the student first arrives at the gym and swipes their card, the login board
            will access the student’s history and generates a workout plan for the session.</li>
          <li><strong>Automatic User-based Settings For Workout Machine: </strong>Each individual workout machine would
            have it’s own data connection, and will be able to access the student’s history. Each machine would set up
            it’s own weights, resistances, training times, and other settings to create a “just-right” challenge for the
            student.</li>
          <li><strong>Workout Machine Sensors</strong>The workout machines would have sensors built into them to measure
            the physical state of the student as the machine is being used. The workout could then be adjusted on the
            fly
            to match the physical condition of the student. The machine itself could tell when the student needed to
            rest,
            and could suggest that the student hydrate when needed, unlocking an on-site drink dispenser to provide
            hydration.</li>
        </ul>

      </p>

      <h2>User Research Round 1 - A Micro Method, and a Macro One </h2>
      <p>Now that we had some scoping and preliminary concepting done, it was time to conduct user research to
        understand
        real user needs, and to see if our initial brainstorming was on track. We began by narrowing down the research
        questions we wanted to answer. We ended up with
        5 primary research questions:
        <br>

        <ol>
          <li>What motivates the target audience to exercise?</li>
          <li>What factors prevent target from exercising?</li>
          <li>How does target audience learn how to exercise?</li>
          <li>What kind of exercises does our target audience actually do?</li>
          <li>What resources does our target audience use to enable their exercise?</li>
        </ol>

        After defining our research questions we then narrowed down what methods we would be to answer them. For
        Research Question 1, 2, and 4
        we chose to go with a diary study. We felt that we would get more specific and more honest answers for these
        questions if we asked them "in the moment", as participants were completing their exercises. For research
        questions 3, 4, and 5, we chose to go with a survey, as these were questions tightly-tied to scale, with the
        most important part of the questions being "how much", rather than "what"? Research question 4 double-dipped
        into
        both methods because
        it easily fit into both methods
        and getting validation from both methods would strengthen the overall results.
      </p>

      <h3>Diary Study Setup</h3>
      <p>For our diary study we chose to reach out to our social networks and recruit 3 people to take our diary study
        for 6 days. We informed the participants that there will be a monetary gift card awarded for completion of the
        diary study. The goal of the diary study was to gain insight into the day-to-day exercise motivations and
        barriers that our participants faced (Research Questions 1 and 2). In particular, we were hoping to gain insight
        into novel barrier situations that would not have occurred to us to include in our survey. Results from the
        diary study were analyzed with a light affinity wall analysis to pull out the key concepts, and then were
        organized against the research questions, pairing them with the corresponding survey results for each question.
      </p>

      <h3>Survey Setup</h3>
      <p>As previously mentioned, for the survey we focused on answering research questions 3, 4 and 5. We wrote a
        simple survey with about 16 questions. After creating the survey we distributed the survey on multiple channels.
        The first channel we sent out our survey is through the UMSI list serve. After this, we distributed it on 5
        college forums on the popular social media website, Reddit. The 5 college schools were: University of California
        at Berkeley, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, University of Central Florida, Georgia Institute of
        Technology, and University of Michigan. During our recruiting, we indicated that taking the survey will enroll
        them into a raffle if they wished to leave their email at the end. After 5 days we cut off data collection with
        176 responses. For the preliminary demographic results of the survey, 142 responses marked that they exercised
        in the past 2 weeks of taking the survey. About 49% were female, 47% were male and ~3% didn’t disclose or were
        nonbinary.</p>

      <h3>Round 1 Research Results</h3>

      <p> We had a rough mapping of survey and diary questions relative to their corresponding research question. To analysis our results, we first tabulated our quantitative 
        data and performed light affinity wall analysis to categorize our qualitative data from the diary.   We then 
        formalized this mapping during our post-survey analysis, directly relating the results of each study question
        back
        to a core research question. 
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-2"></div>
            <div class="col-8">
              <figure href="/assets/LG/ms2_data_whiteboard.jpg" class="figure" data-toggle="lightbox"
                data-footer="Extended mapping of survey results to research questions">
                <img src="/assets/LG/ms2_data_whiteboard.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Extended mapping of survey results to research questions</figcaption>
              </figure>
            </div>
            <div class="col-2"></div>
          </div>
    
        
        By having this mapping viewable on a whiteboard as a whole, we were also able to
        see
        patterns between the different activities and questions, which lead us to three core insights:

        <ol>
          <li>Lack of time/time management.</li>
          <li>Endurance and Strength exercises were the most prominent forms of exercise.</li>
          <li>Users often need guidance when doing exercises to learn how to do them correctly.</li>
        </ol>
