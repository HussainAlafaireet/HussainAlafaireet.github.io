        <blockquote>How can a Virtual Reality environment subtly, but effectively direct the users attention?</blockquote>
      </div>



    <div class=project-intro-box>
      <p><strong>Role: </strong> UX Designer, Full-Stack Developer &nbsp;|&nbsp; <strong>Duration: </strong>4 Weeks
        <br>
        <strong>Tools Used: </strong>Unity Game Engine, SteamVR (for running the Maze on a VR headset)
        <br>
        <strong>UX Skills Used: </strong>VR Prototyping, Usability Testing, VR UX Design
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Summary: </strong> Virtual Reality presents a unique challenge for immersive experiences, as <strong>the user
        has the freedom to look in all directions at any time</strong>. This freedom makes it
        possible for the <strong>user to be looking in the wrong place at the wrong time</strong>, and miss seeing key portions of the
        experience.
        <br>
        <br>
        The VR Clues Maze is an immersive experience that balances <strong>user freedom versus directed attention</strong>.
        The VR Clues Maze <strong>generates a unique layout</strong> every time the software is run. <strong>Clues are then
        intelligently added</strong> to subtly direct the user out of the maze.

        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>My Contributions: </strong> I co-designed the VR Clues Maze with my partner on this
        project, <a href="https://vladimirdesigns.me/">Vlad Potiyevskiy</a></strong>.
        <strongI designed the overall look-and-feel></strong> of the virtual environment, and <strong>developed the lighting setup</strong> required to achieve the desired atmosphere.
       
        <br>
        <br>
        As developer, <strong>I developed a path-finding solution that could
        automatically
        find a path through the randomized maze</strong>. I then <strong>implemented a system to dynamically add clues around this path</strong>,
        providing the user guidance on how to get of the maze.
      </p>

    <a name="process"></a>
    <h2 class="text-center"><strong>Process</strong></h2>

 

    <p>
      My initial inspiration for this project was my experience with the <a
        href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1592039100813771/">Ghost in the Shell</a> VR app.
      The app plays out like a short movie, centering around a chaotic fight scene in a large room. While using the app, <strong>I observed a repeated problem</strong>.
      Since I had
      full ability to look in all directions, <strong>I would often be looking in the wrong direction</strong> to see an important part of the scene. This brought on the realization
      that <strong>VR experiences need some ability to effectively direct the users attention</strong>, while still allowing the users
      complete viewing freedom.
      <br>
      <br>
      The VR Clues Maze is a VR environment designed to <strong>direct the users attention through lighting and subtle
      environment cues</strong>.

      <br>
      <br>
      Here's the <strong>process we used</strong> to develop the Maze:

    <h3>Brainstorming</h3>

    <p>
      This project was occurring in the context of a design challenge with <strong>4 weeks allowed for design and development</strong>.

      My partner and I had relatively free rein over the nature and content of the project, but we knew that <strong>scoping
      would be critical</strong> to meet our deadline.
      We therefore made a substantial effort during our first brainstorming session
      to <strong>prioritize
      our feature set</strong>.

    <h3>Timeline</h3>
    <p>
      As our overall development window was quite short for a project this ambitious, Vlad and I designed a
      timetable that would allow us to deliver a complete package, while assessing our status, and pruning our feature 
      set as needed.  Our timeline design produced the process/timeline map above.
    <br>
    <br>

    <h2>Scoping</h2>

    <div class="callout">
        <blockquote>How can we integrate a way to give player clues INTO a maze system that 
          randomly changes layout every time the maze is created? 
        </blockquote>
      </div>

    <h3>Technical Exploration</h3>
    <br>

      <p>
        Our first major phase of work on the project was the <strong>Technical Exploration phase</strong>.  In this phase, we would <strong>create proof-of-concepts versions of 
        our two design pillars</strong>: Random Maze Generation, and a Dynamic Clue System.  By creating these proof-of-concepts, we would be able to tell whether or not
        our project was feasible by our deadlines.  
      </p>


    <h4>Random Maze Generation</h4>
    <p>Vlad took on the task of <strong>exploring the Unity random maze tutorial</strong>, and bringing it into our VR environment. The
      tutorial was sound, and we were able to implement the majority of the maze in VR without
      major issues. The <strong>implementation initially treated the maze as a 2-D maze, generating a series of flat tiles</strong>. The
      implementation then
      <strong>added walls, doors, and wall hangings</strong> to create a 3-D maze. My partner and I <strong>added additional wall and floor
      textures,</strong> to make the maze more resemble the theming we were going for.

      </div>

      <h4>Dynamic Clue System</h4>
      While Vlad worked on the random generation system, <strong>I began work on
      adding the dynamic lighting/clue system</strong>. First, I needed to design how this system would work. The system needed
      <strong>3 main components</strong>:
      <ul>
        <li>A <strong>designed set of clues</strong> that could be used to hint at the correct direction to get out of the maze.</li>
        <li>A <strong>system to determine the "path" the user should follow</strong> to get out of the maze.</li>
        <li>A system to <strong>dynamically insert clues around that path</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>I first began by creating the initial design for what form the clues should look. I had several ideas for how
      the clues might look, including
      stone lamps, fireflies, and light-reflecting metallic shapes.
    </p>



    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-2"></div>
      <div class="col-8">

        </figure>
      </div>
      <div class="col-2"></div>
    </div>



    <p>

      Out of the three options, I went with the stone lamp.  The stone lamp balanced the use of a light to drive attention with the subtlety to look natural
      in our overall environment.  I sourced an appropriate lamp model, and started integrating it into our VR environment.
      <br>
      <br>
      
      I began by <strong>tuning the ambient
      lighting environment</strong> within the maze. I added a sourced night-sky skybox,
      and adjusting the overall ambient lighting to be a little dim. <strong>These adjustments allowed the user to see, but not
      incredibly well</strong>. This lighting
      situation would cause our eventual light-based clues and player-interactable torches to have
      immediate value to the player. I then created <strong>a maze module with the lamp,
      a
      light source, and a wall</strong>. We then added this module to the list of modules the random maze generator would use.
      Now, our maze would have <strong>lamps randomly-placed to provide
      a level of lighting support for the player</strong>.
    </p>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-2"></div>
      <div class="col-8">
        <figure href="/assets/ProcMaz/proc_maze_lantern_shot.PNG" class="figure" data-toggle="lightbox"
          data-footer="Initial Lantern Module">
          <img src="/assets/ProcMaz/proc_maze_lantern_shot.PNG" alt="" class="img-fluid">

          </figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
      <div class="col-2"></div>
    </div>

    <p>Now that we had lamps integrated into the maze, <strong>I needed to find a way to make the lamps "clues"</strong> to guide the
      player out.
      It occurred to me as I built the initial lamps that a more subtle way to handle adding clues was to use design
      elements that were already present.
      I had sourced a Japanese Oni mask as part of a more generic
      wall module that we were using to establish a Japanese theme for the maze. <strong>I decided to combine the mask with
      the lantern prefab to create a clue</strong>. I created a <strong>new version of the lantern module</strong>,
      but with the exception of having a <strong>tiny version of the Japanese Mask now embedded in it's side</strong>. The intent was
      to place these "clue" lanterns in addition to the random ones. While seeming random, <strong> these "clue" lanterns would
      actually be placed in the direction the user should go</strong> to get out of the maze.

    <h3>Scoping Assessment</h3>
    <p>At the end of the Technical Exploration phase, <strong>Vlad and I assessed our status</strong>. Our proof-of-concepts had worked out successfully,
      so we made the determination that <strong>our project could be completed by the deadline</strong>.
      Our next step was to iterate to a full Version 1 of the Maze, with <strong>each one of us
      building out proof-of-concepts of the two remaining features</strong>. Vlad took on the Player Interactions component, while <strong>I took
      on the Maze-Finding component</strong> of the Dynamic Clue System feature.  
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2>Iteration</h2>
  

    <h3>Mazefinding Development</h3>
    <br>

    <p>For the first development iteration, I needed to finish up the Dynamic Clue System.  Now that I had the visual design of a clue worked out, <strong>it was time to figure out how to place the clue</strong>. 
      To do this, I would need an algorithm to find a path out of each generated maze.  I would then placed the clues along this path.

      <br>
      <br>
      I <strong>looked into several pre-existing algorithms</strong>, such as <a
        href="http://www.primaryobjects.com/2013/05/13/solving-mazes-with-ai-pathfinding-techniques-a-vs-tremaux/">Tremaux's</a>
      and <a href="http://traceymccabe.com/maze-solving/">Pledge's</a>, and tested an implementation
      of Pledge's in the Maze. However, these algorithms - they only
      worked for "simple" mazes that have only corridors. Our maze could generate small courtyard-style open spaces,
      and Pledge's failed when hitting one of those locations.
      <br>
      <br>
      Going back to the drawing board, I decided to try using <a
        href="https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html">breadth-first search</a>, as this
      algorithm was capable of handling the courtyard spaces.
      I was
      able to find several existing implementations of it for tile mazes, including one by
      the <a href="https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/hex-map/part-16/">same individual that had developed the
        procedural maze code we were using</a>. Based on these implementations, <strong>I was able to create an implementation
      of my own,
      scanning the tiles in the Maze, and marking the tiles that lead to the exit</strong> by changing their colors.
    </p>

    <div class="row">

      <div class="col-10">
        <figure href="/assets/ProcMaz/proc_maze_bfs_path.PNG" class="figure" data-toggle="lightbox" data-footer="Overhead view and POV view of BFS-marked tiles leading to the
          end tile.">

          <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Overhead view and POV view of BFS-marked tiles leading to the

        </figure>
      </div>
      <div class="col-1"></div>
    </div>


    <p>Now that I had a system with which to mark the path, <strong>I could start adding clues to mark the path</strong>.
      The algorithm I developed for adding the clues <strong>stepped through each floor tile on the path</strong>, and performed <strong>two
      actions</strong> for each tile:
      <ul>
        <li>The algorithm <strong>checked to see if the tile was a "third tile"</strong> - every third tile on the path was a candidate
          for placing a clue This would add just enough clues to be useful, without making the Maze too easy to get out
          of.</li>
        <li>If the tile was in fact a "third" tile, the algorithm would <strongcheck to see if the tile in question had a wall></strong>.
          If so, the algorithm <strong>replaced it with a wall that had a clue-lantern</strong>.</li>
      </ul>

      The algorithm was deployed just after the initial maze generation, and would add the clue lanterns just
      before the user was able to exploring the maze.

    <h3>Live Usability Testing </h3>

    <p>
      As planned, we tested our Version 1 on users to gain initial feedback. We <strong>tested with 3 users</strong>, also participating
      in the design challenge. Testing consisted of undirected
      use of the Maze, <strong>with users giving feedback as they played</strong>. The user's first-person view was
      accessible via a separate monitor, which <strong>allowed for direct observation</strong>.
      <br>
      <br>
      Our users had <strong>varying levels of VR background</strong>, but all had been <strong>trained in basic VR design best practices</strong>, which
      allowed them to give a strong mix of user/expert feedback.

    <h3>Feedback Iteration </h3>

    <p>For our final iteration, Vlad and I tried to address as many of the feedback points as possible, as well as
      adding two minor features for greater user enjoyment.</p>

    <p>We conducted a <strong>second round of live usability testing</strong> on Version 2 of the Maze.  10 participants of similar background to the first testing participated.
    Several of the primary users were <strong>paired with a second participant</strong> who used the Overhead View to guide the user around the maze.

        <p class="text-center">
          With the <strong>addition of the tutorial, lighting, and additional clues</strong>, our users were able to <strong>navigate our maze
          far easier than Version 1</strong>. They were able
          to <strong>backtrack far easier</strong>, and reached the end of the maze with far more frequency.

        <p class="text-center">
          With the use of the overview map, we were able to add a second user as a helper to the experience. <strong>Users
          enjoyed the interplay between user and helper.</strong> The presence of the helper
          allowed users with weaker navigation skills to still enjoy the overall experience.

        </h4>
        <p class="text-center">
          With the celebration area, users had a <strong>clear feedback mechanism for telling that they had succeeded</strong>. The

        <p class="text-center">
          The <strong>clues remained of only limited use</strong>. While the greater frequency made them more likely to be noticed, the
