      <h1>VR Attention Direction within a Procedural Maze</h1>


      <h2>Project Overview - A Procedurally Generated VR Maze With Dynamic Clues</h2>
      <p>
        In this project, I worked with a partner to explore a single question: <strong>How can we subtly, but
          effectively direct attention within a virtual environment?</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        To explore this question, we built a VR procedurally generated maze, and experimented with dyamically adding
        subtle clues to the environment to guide the user to the exit.

      <h2>My Contributions - Mazefinding and Dynamic Lights </h2>
      <p>
        My primary contributions to this project were as follows:
        <ol>
          <li>The implementation of a mazefinding algorithm to find a path through a procedurally generated maze
            at run-time.</li>
          <li>The development of a "clue" system to guide players to the end of the maze.</li>

        </ol>
      </p>

      <h2>Problem to be Solved - How can we organically direct attention in VR?</h2>

      <p>VR environments present designers with many challenges specific to the medium. One such design challenge is the
        flexiblity
        users have in viewing the environment. In more traditional 3-D environment experiences (ones explored with 2-D
        screens), it's possible to expliclity direct
        the users attention by taking control of the user's camera and perspective to expliclity direct the user. This
        is
        less feasible in Head-Mounted Display (HMD) VR, due to the immersion-breaking and potential
        user disorientation that goes with seizing control of the users perspective. VR Experiences therefore need to be
        less direct when wanting to grab the users's attention and direct their view. While overt methods like </p>


      <h2>Initial Ideation and Scoping</h2>

      <p>This project was occuring in the context of a design challenge to be conducted over the course of a month of
        development.
        My partner and I had relatively free rein over the nature and content of the project, but we knew that scoping
        would be critical. We therefore brainstormed
        We therefore made a substantial effort during our first brainstorming session to define the scope concretly, and
        to prioritize
        our feature set.

      <p>
        Our brainstorming session ended with the following scoping points:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Oculus/Unity Platform:</strong> We came to an agreement that we would be developing the VR
            experience for the Oculus Rift, as that was the most capable VR platform we
            had access to. We also decided to develop the experience in the Unity game engine, as we both felt it was
            the best balance of features and ease of environment construction out of
            the development environment we both had access to.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Procedurally-generated Maze:</strong> We found the idea of a procedurally generated maze to be a
            fascinating addition to our overall
            question of organically directing attention. Ordinarily, for a project like this, we would not have
            considered procedural generation, as building this capability from
            scratch would have been too technically challenging for the time we had. However, we found a <a
              href="https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/maze/">substantial Unity tutorial on procedural maze
              generation</a>, which we hoped
            would lead us through the process of building the maze. However, we knew that we would need to test this
            detail
          </li>
          <li><strong>Lighting:</strong> Both of us had used the most basic of Unity's lighting capabilities, but not at
            the level we needed to for this project. Our primary concern had to do with the
            adaptive lighting we were already considering. We needed to develop the underlying system for adding dynamic
            lightings, as well as ensure that the performance impact of the added lighting
            did not impact the framerate of the experience.
          </li>
          <li><strong>A look-and-feel based in folklore/light supernatural horror:</strong> My partner and I both liked
            the idea of a "haunted" maze with a somewhat supernatural feel, to enhance the feeling of "needing to
            escape."
            We did come to the agreement that we didn't want to make a true horror game, as we felt VR was too immersive
            for that to be comfortable for our players. However, we thought that light supernatural-themed elements
            would get players
            more engaged with the experience. We were considering both traditional European and traditional Japanese themes
            for our supernatural elements.

              </div>
        
          </li>
          <li><strong>Player Interactions:</strong>Since this was a game, we did want to have a high-degree of player
            interactions. However, we were
            not sure to what extent this would be possible within our development window. Our highest priority was a
            torch the player could use to light the maze, as
            we were already intending on using light as a theme for our environment. Other achievable interactions
            included keys with which to open doors, teleportation movement to allow movement without motion sickness,
            and keys to open doors. As an extreme challenged, we wanted to have a few non-player characters (NPCS) that
            players could interact with. However,
            we knew this was a significant technical challenge, and the most likely to be unfeasible.</li>

      <h2>Prototype Version 1</h2>
      <p>The procedural maze source was sound, and we were able to implement the majority of the maze in VR without major issues.

        I then began work on 
        adding the dynamic lighting/clue system.  First, I needed to design how this system would work.  The system needed 2 main components:
        <ul>
          <li>A system to determine the "path" the user should follow to get out of the maze.</li>
          <li>A system to be able to dynamically insert clues around that path to give hints to users about how to get to the exit.</li>
        </ul>
