        <p><strong>Role: </strong> UX Designer, VR Developer &nbsp;|&nbsp; <strong>Duration: </strong>4 Weeks
          <br>
          <strong>Tools Used: </strong>Unity Game Engine, SteamVR
          <br>
          <strong>UX Skills Used: </strong>VR Prototyping, Usability Testing, VR UX Design
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Summary: </strong> Virtual Reality presents a unique challenge for immersive experiences, as
          <strong>the user
            has the freedom to look in all directions at any time</strong>. This freedom makes it
          possible for the <strong>user to be looking in the wrong place at the wrong time</strong>, and miss seeing key
          portions of the
          experience.
          <br>
          <br>
          The VR Clues Maze is an immersive experience that balances <strong>user freedom versus directed
            attention</strong>.
          The VR Clues Maze <strong>generates a unique layout</strong> every time the software is run. <strong>Clues are
            then
            intelligently added</strong> to subtly direct the user out of the maze.

          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>My Contributions: </strong>
          <br>
          <br>

          I co-designed the VR Clues Maze with my partner on this
          project, <a href="https://vladimirdesigns.me/">Vlad Potiyevskiy</a></strong>.
          <br>
          <br>
          As <strong>UX Designer</strong>, I generated the project concept and designed the look-and-feel of the virtual
          environment.

          <br>
          <br>
          As <strong>VR Developer</strong>, I developed a system that dynamically added navigation clues to a randomized
          VR maze.

      <h2 class="text-center"><strong>Process</strong></h2>



      <p>
        My initial inspiration for this project was my experience with the <a
          href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1592039100813771/">Ghost in the Shell</a> VR app.
        The app plays out like a short movie, centering around a chaotic fight scene in a large room. While using the
        app,
        <strong>I observed a repeated problem</strong>.
        Since I had
        full ability to look in all directions, <strong>I would often be looking in the wrong direction</strong> to see
        an
        important part of the scene.
      </p>

        <p class="figure-caption text-center">I have no clue where I'm supposed to be looking here!
        </p>
        
        
        <br>
        <p>
        This brought on the realization
        that <strong>VR experiences need some ability to effectively direct the users attention</strong>, while still
        allowing the users
        complete viewing freedom.
        <br>
        <br>
        The VR Clues Maze is a VR environment designed to <strong>direct the users attention through lighting and subtle
          environment cues</strong>.

      <h3>Brainstorming</h3>

      <p>
        This project was occurring in the context of a design challenge with <strong>4 weeks allowed for design and
          development</strong>.
        <br>
        <br>

        To maximize our time, our first brainstorming session concentrated on a prioritized feature set.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4>VR Clues Maze Features</h4>
      <p>
        <h4><small>Randomly-Generated Maze</small></h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Our Maze would <strong>generate a random layout</strong> each time the app ran. This would add
            <strong>significant replayability</strong> to the app.</li>
          <li>This feature would be a technical challenge, but <strong>we had a <a href="">Unity tutorial</a> to work
              off of.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <h4><small>Atmospheric Lighting</small></h4>
        <ul>
          <li>We saw the <strong>lights in the environment</strong> as a key <strong>attention direction</strong>
            tool.</li>
          <li>We knew <strong>correct optimization of lighting</strong> was needed to ensure <strong>smooth VR
              performance</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><small>Supernatural Theme</small></h4>
        <ul>
          <li>We went with a <strong>Japanese-based supernatural look-and feel</strong>, as this would provide a more
            unique immersive experience.</li>
          <li>Supernatural theme would be kept "light" to <strong>avoid truly scaring users</strong>. We would avoid
            gore and shock value in our design.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><small>Dynamic Clue System</small></h4>
        <ul>
          <li>To <strong>guide attention</strong>, we would build a <strong>system that would add clues</strong> to
            the maze. These clues would direct players on where
            to go.</li>
          <li>Adding this feature to a randomly-generated maze was a <strong>significant design and technical
              challenge</strong>, as the
            solution would need to work without
            knowing the layout ahead of time.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4><small>Player Interactions</small></h4>
        <ul>
          <li>We did want player interactions, both as a design challenge, and to increase player immersion.</li>
          <li>We knew that this area had the <strong>potential to overwhelm us</strong> .</li>
          <li>Discussed interactions included:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Torches</strong> for extra lighting sources </li>
              <li><strong>Keys</strong> to open doors in the maze</li>
              <li><strong>Non-player characters</strong> (NPCs) for the player to interact with.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h3>Technical Exploration</h3>
      <br>

      <p>
        Our first major phase of work on the project was the <strong>Technical Exploration phase</strong>. In this
        phase, we would <strong>create proof-of-concepts versions of
          our two design pillars</strong>: Random Maze Generation, and a Dynamic Clue System.

    </div>

    <div class="container m1">


      <h4>Random Maze Generation</h4>
      <p>Vlad took on the task of <strong>exploring the Unity random maze tutorial</strong>, and bringing it into our VR
        environment. We then <strong>added
          additional wall and floor
          textures,</strong> to make the maze more resemble the theming we were going for.

    <div class="container m1">
      <h4>Dynamic Clue System</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>I began work on
          adding the dynamic lighting/clue system</strong>. The
        system needed
        <strong>3 main components</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>A <strong>designed set of clues</strong> that could be used to hint at the correct direction to get out
            of the maze.</li>
          <li>A <strong>system to determine the "path" the user should follow</strong> to get out of the maze.</li>
          <li>A system to <strong>dynamically insert clues around that path</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>


      <br>

      <p>I first began by creating the visual design for the appearance of the clues:
      </p>

      <figure href="/assets/ProcMaz/p_initial clues.jpg" class="figure" data-toggle="lightbox"
        data-footer="Brainstorming Clue System">
        <img src="/assets/ProcMaz/p_initial clues.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
        <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Brainstorming Clue System
        </figcaption>
      </figure>




      <p>

        Out of the three options, the stone lamp best integrated the function of a light source with a natural look. I
        sourced an appropriate lamp model, and started integrating it into our VR
        environment.
        <br>
        <br>

        I tuned the ambient light with the maze to be a little dim. This lighting environment would naturally direct the
        player towards the lamps, automatically exposing them to the clue system.
        <br>
        <br>
        I then created <strong>a maze module with the lamp,
          a
          light source, and a wall</strong>. We then added this module to the list of modules the random maze
        generator would use.
        Now, our maze would have <strong>lamps randomly-placed to provide
          a level of lighting support for the player</strong>.


      </p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-2"></div>
        <div class="col-8">
          <figure href="/assets/ProcMaz/proc_maze_lantern_shot.PNG" class="figure" data-toggle="lightbox"
            data-footer="Initial Lantern Module">
            <img src="/assets/ProcMaz/proc_maze_lantern_shot.PNG" alt="" class="img-fluid">
            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Initial Lantern Module

          </figure>
        </div>
        <div class="col-2"></div>
      </div>

      <p>Now that we had lamps integrated into the maze, <strong>I needed to find a way to make the lamps
          "clues"</strong> to guide the
        player out.
        <br>
        <br>
        I had sourced a Japanese Oni mask as part of a more generic
        wall module that we were using to establish a Japanese theme for the maze. I created a <strong>new version of
          the lantern module</strong> that had a <strong>tiny version of the Japanese Mask now embedded in it's
          side</strong>.
        <br>
        <br>
      </p>


      <figure href="/assets/ProcMaz/proc_maze_mask_shot.PNG" class="figure" data-toggle="lightbox"
        data-footer="Japanese Mask used as wall ornament.">
        <img src="/assets/ProcMaz/proc_maze_mask_shot.PNG" alt="" class="img-fluid">
        <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Japanese Mask used as wall ornament.

        <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Japanese Mask added to lantern as clue indicator.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>While seeming random, <strong> these "clue" lanterns would
          actually be placed in the direction the user should go</strong> to get out of the maze.</p>

    </div>

      <h3>Mazefinding Development</h3>
      <br>

      <p>Now that I had the visual
        design of a clue worked out, <strong>it was time to figure out how to place the clues to guide the player
          out</strong>.
        To do this, I would need an algorithm to find a path out of each generated maze. I would then placed the clues
        along this path.

        <br>
        <br>
        I decided to use a <a href="https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html">breadth-first
          search algorithm</a>, as this
        algorithm was capable of handling the open courtyard spaces our maze produced.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>The initial implementation I created
          scanned the tiles in the Maze, and marked the tiles that lead to the exit</strong> by changing their colors.
      </p>


      <figure href="/assets/ProcMaz/proc_maze_bfs_path.PNG" class="figure" data-toggle="lightbox" data-footer="Overhead view and POV view of BFS-marked tiles leading to the
          end tile.">
        <img src="/assets/ProcMaz/proc_maze_bfs_path.PNG" alt="" class="img-fluid">
        <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Overhead view and POV view of BFS-marked tiles leading to the
          end tile.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>



      <p><strong>I could now start adding clues to mark the
          path</strong>.
        The algorithm I developed for adding the clues and
        performed <strong>two
          actions</strong> for each tile on the path:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The algorithm <strong>checked to see if the tile was a "third tile"</strong> - every third tile on the path
          was a candidate
          for placing a clue. This would add just enough clues to be useful, without making the Maze too easy to get out
          of.</li>
        <li>If the tile was in fact a "third" tile, the algorithm would <strong></strong>check to see if the tile in
          question had
          a wall</strong>.
          If so, the algorithm <strong>replaced it with a wall that had a clue-lantern</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <br>

      <h3>Usability Testing </h3>

      <p>
        As planned, we tested our Version 1 on users to gain initial feedback. Testing consisted of undirected
        use of the Maze, <strong>with users giving feedback as they played</strong>. The user's first-person view was

        <h4>Testing Feedback</h4>
        <br>

        <h4><small>Players used the Lamp Clues As Primary Navigation Aids</small></h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Users cited the <strong>lamps as the primary navigation aids</strong> they used to understand the maze
            structure.</li>
          <li>This use confirmed the decision to use the <strong>lamps as the focus</strong> for the clue system.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4><small>Players Became Too Easily Disorientated In the Maze</small></h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Disorientation was due to <strong>5 design factors</strong>:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>The floor textures were the same</strong> throughout the maze.
              </li>
              <li>
                VR Teleporting <strong>moved users instantly</strong> through space.
              </li>
              <li>
                The <strong>environment was too dark</strong> to pick out any landmarks.
              </li>
              <li>The <strong>clue lanterns were used too infrequently</strong> to act as guides.</li>
              <li>There was <strong>not enough feedback when the user reached the end</strong> of the maze.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4><small>Players used a "Least Explored" Path-finding Strategy</small></h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Users <strong>navigated the maze with a least-explored strategy</strong>, always attempting to go
            where they had not
            been before.</li>
          <li>This strategy only had limited success, as <strong>users were not able to tell easily where they had
              been</strong>.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4><small>Users Wanted to Build a Mental Maze Map</small></h4>
        <ul>
          <li> <strong>Users were frustrated</strong>
            that the app did not support their need to <strong>build an internal mental map</strong> of the Maze.
          </li>
          <li>Users stressed the <strong>need to have "safe" landmarks</strong> to fall back on, so that they were
            never totally lost.</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Feedback Iteration </h3>

      <p>For our final iteration, Vlad and I tried to address as many of the feedback points as possible, as well as
        adding two minor features for greater user enjoyment.</p>

      <br>


      <div class="container m1">
        <h4>Additional Clue Type</h4>
        <figure href="/assets/ProcMaz/proc_maze_floorclue.PNG" class="figure" data-toggle="lightbox"
          data-footer="Floor-type Clue">
          <img src="/assets/ProcMaz/proc_maze_floorclue.PNG" alt="" class="img-fluid border border-secondary">
          <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>To address the need for more clues, <strong>I added a new clue type </strong> that could be embedded into
          floor tiles.
          I also <strong>increased the frequency of clues</strong> to every other tile.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="container m1">
        <h4>End of User Celebration Area</h4>
        <figure href="/assets/ProcMaz/proc_maze_celeb.PNG" class="figure" data-toggle="lightbox"
          data-footer="Celebration Area">
          <img src="/assets/ProcMaz/proc_maze_celeb.PNG" alt="" class="img-fluid border border-secondary">
          <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>To provide <strong>better end-of-maze feedback</strong>, I <strong>added a Japanese-themed celebration
            area</strong> that the user would see upon maze completion. </p>
      </div>


      <div class="container m1">
        <h4>Overhead View Implementation</h4>
        <figure href="/assets/ProcMaz/proc_maze_overheadview.PNG" class="figure" data-toggle="lightbox"
          data-footer="Overhead View">
          <img src="/assets/ProcMaz/proc_maze_overheadview.PNG" alt="" class="img-fluid border border-secondary">
          <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We demoed the game using the Unity editor directly, and we noticed an interesting behavior from users.
          <strong>Demo-goers not wearing the headset were able to view the active player's position
            on the overhead view in Unity</strong>, and could guide the active player through the maze. We added this
          as a formal feature to optionally aid navigation.</p>
      </div>


      <div class="container m1">
        <h4>Tutorial Area</h4>
        <figure href="/assets/ProcMaz/proc_maze_tutorial.PNG" class="figure" data-toggle="lightbox"
          data-footer="Tutorial Area">

          <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>My partner <strong>added an initial tutorial zone</strong> that the player enters prior to the maze itself.
          This tutorial area
          had instructions for <strong>player controls</strong>, the goal of <strong>finding the end of the
            maze</strong>, <strong>player interactables</strong>, and the <strong>need to look for
            clues</strong>.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="container m1">
        <h4>Player Light</h4>
      <figure href="/assets/ProcMaz/proc_maze_playerlight.PNG" class="figure" data-toggle="lightbox"
        data-footer="PLayer Light">

        <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p> To <strong>address the darkness of the environment</strong>, I added a dim light to the player module.
        This created a <strong>small but constant light source</strong> that guaranteed the player could always see.

      <p>We conducted a <strong>second round of live usability testing</strong> on Version 2 of the Maze. 10
        participants of similar background to the first testing participated.
        Several of the primary users were <strong>paired with a second participant</strong> who used the Overhead View
        to guide the user around the maze.
