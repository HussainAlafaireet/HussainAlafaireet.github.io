I'm currently a Masters of Information student at the University of Michigan.  In my original college life,
I was a programmer, primarily with C++.  I've been working in the IT industry for 6+ years, with my last stint being at IBM.  There I performed analytics on IBM mainframes for enterprise-level clients.

I am currently planning on going into User Experience, specifically within the realms of Augmented and Virtual Reality.
