I started off my professional life in software development, where the
human-computer interaction side stirred my interest more than any
other aspect of that life. I then spent close to a decade in enterprise IT,
before deciding that I needed to pivot my career, and make my love of
user-centered design my profession!

My goal as a UX professional is to use research and design to create a
sense of tranquility and mindfulness. Through thoughtful exploration
of user desires, combined with tempered, targeted design, I seek to
create products that give people a space of quiet comfort in their busy
lives.
